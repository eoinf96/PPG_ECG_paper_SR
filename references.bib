@article{Xie2021,
abstract = {Objective. Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive and continuous method for evaluating stroke volume and cardiac output. However, the ICG measurement is easily interfered due to respiration and body movements. Taking into consideration about the spectral correlations between the simultaneously collected ICG, electrocardiogram (ECG), and acceleration signals, this paper introduces a two-step spectrum denoising method to remove motion artifacts of ICG measurements in both resting and exercising scenarios. Approach. First, the major motion artifacts of ECG and ICG are separately suppressed by the spectral subtraction with respect to acceleration signals. The obtained ECG and ICG are further decomposed into two sets of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) through the ensemble empirical mode decomposition. We then extract the shared spectral information between the two sets of IMFs using the canonical correlation analysis in a spectral domain. Finally, the ICG signal is reconstructed using those canonical variates with largest spectral correlations with ECG IMFs. Main results. The denoising method was evaluated for 30 subjects under both resting and cycling scenarios. Experimental results show that the beat contribution factor of ICG signals increases from its original 80.1{\%}-97.4{\%} after removing the motion artifacts. Significance. The proposed denoising scheme effectively improves the reliability of diagnosis and analysis on cardiovascular diseases relying on ICG signals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The heart ejects in the central elastic arteries. No previous study in workers described the diurnal profile of central blood pressure (BP) or addressed the question whether electrocardiogram (ECG) indexes are more closely associated with central than peripheral BP. METHODS In 177 men (mean age, 29.1 years), we compared the associations of ECG indexes with brachial and central ambulatory BP, measured over 24 hours by the validated oscillometric Mobil-O-Graph 24h PWA monitor. RESULTS From wakefulness to sleep, as documented by diaries, systolic/diastolic BP decreased by 11.7/13.1 mm Hg peripherally and 9.3/13.6 mm Hg centrally, whereas central pulse pressure (PP) increased by 4.3 mm Hg (P {\textless} 0.0001). Over 24 hours and the awake and asleep periods, the peripheral-minus-central differences in systolic/diastolic BPs averaged 11.8/-1.6, 12.7/-1.8, and 10.3/-1.2 mm Hg, respectively (P {\textless} 0.0001). Cornell voltage and index averaged 1.18 mV and 114.8 mV{\textperiodcentered}ms. Per 1-SD increment in systolic/diastolic BP, the Cornell voltages were 0.104/0.086 mV and 0.082/0.105 mV higher in relation to brachial 24-hour and asleep BP and 0.088/0.90 mV and 0.087/0.107 mV higher in relation to central BP. The corresponding estimates for the Cornell indexes were 9.6/8.6 and 8.2/10.5 mV{\textperiodcentered}ms peripherally and 8.6/8.9 and 8.8/10.7 mV{\textperiodcentered}ms centrally. The regression slopes (P ≥ 0.067) and correlation coefficients (P ≥ 0.088) were similar for brachial and central BP. Associations of ECG measurements with awake BP and PP were not significant. CONCLUSIONS Peripheral and central BPs run in parallel throughout the day and are similarly associated with the Cornell voltage and index.},

abstract = {Ballistocardiography (BCG) is a non-invasive technique used to measure the ejection force of blood into the aorta which can be used to estimate cardiac output and contractility change. In this work, a noise sensor was embedded in a BCG measurement system to detect excessive motion from standing subjects. For nine healthy subjects, the cross-correlation of the motion signal to the BCG noise-estimated using a simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram and statistics of the BCG signal-was found to be 0.94 and 0.87, during periods of standing still and with induced motion artifacts, respectively. In a separate study, where 35 recordings were taken from seven subjects, a threshold-based algorithm was used to flag motion-corrupted segments of the BCG signal using only the auxiliary motion sensor. Removing these flagged segments enhanced the BCG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by an average of 14 dB (P {\textless} 0.001). This integrated motion-sensing technique addresses a gap in methods available to identify and remove noise in standing BCG recordings due to movement, in a practical manner that does not require user intervention or obtrusive sensing. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {The Finapres non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitor uses the method of Penaz to indirectly record the arterial waveform; studies on its accuracy have suggested little systematic bias vs intra-arterial pressure (IAP) but substantial variability. Inconsistency between studies, in respect of the magnitude, direction and variance of bias, was described in the validation studies against the direct IAP. We have employed a novel resampling statistical method to combine the data from 20 published studies; a robust overall estimate of the accuracy and precision of the Finapres was thereby obtained. Based on 449 patients and 4490 re-samples, the average Finapres systolic bias (IAP-Finapres) was 2.2 mm Hg (s.d. ± 12.4) with limits of agreement (bias ± 2 s.d.) of -22.6 and 26.9 mm Hg. The average precision was 12.1 mm Hg (s.d. ± 8.4). The Finapres diastolic bias was -0.3 mm Hg (s.d. ± 7.9) with the limits of agreement of -16.1 and 15.5 mm Hg. The average precision was 7.6 mm Hg (s.d. ± 5.3). The average Finapres mean arterial pressure bias was 2.1 mm Hg (s.d. ± 8.6) with precision of 7.6 mm Hg (s.d. ± 5.3). The calculated percentage of Finapres systolic values expected to fall within ± 5 or ± 10 of the direct intra-arterial pressure was 35.9{\%} and 73.1{\%}, respectively. The calculated precision of the Finapres systolic pressure between 0-5 mm Hg was 1.6{\%} and between 0-10 mmHg 36.4{\%}. The comparable values for Finapres diastolic BP for accuracy were 63.5{\%} and 92.8{\%} and for precision 23.1{\%} and 79.2{\%}. The Finapres device can provide an accurate estimate of diastolic and mean arterial pressure compared with the intra-arterial record; the apparent inaccuracy of the Finapres systolic pressure may have a physiological explanation. When the Finapres device is used in experimental or in clinical situations, then calibration against a reliable reference arterial pressure is desirable to obviate the possibility of an 'offset' error.},

With the decline in oestrogen levels, risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) become more apparent, especially hypertension. The onset of hypertension can cause a variety of complaints that are often attributed to the menopause. Risk factor identification is poorly managed in middle-aged women and should be the first step in the evaluation and treatment of women with perimenopausal symptoms. In women at low risk for CHD, there is still a window of opportunity for safe hormone prescription in the first years proximal to menopause.},

abstract = {Context: Geographic variations in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated risk factors have been recognized worldwide. However, little attention has been directed to potential differences in hypertension between Europe and North America. Objective: To determine whether higher blood pressure (BP) levels and hypertension are more prevalent in Europe than in the United States and Canada. Design, Setting, and Participants: Sample surveys that were national in scope and conducted in the 1990s were identified in Germany, Finland, Sweden, England, Spain, Italy, Canada, and the United States. Collaborating investigators provided tabular data in a consistent format by age and sex for persons at least 35 years of age. Population registries were the main basis for sampling. Survey sizes ranged from 1800 to 23 100, with response rates of 61{\%} to 87.5{\%}. The data were analyzed to provide age-specific and age-adjusted estimates of BP and hypertension prevalence by country and region (eg, European vs North American). Main Outcome Measures: Blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in Europe, the United States, and Canada. Results: Average BP was 136/83 mm Hg in the European countries and 127/77 mm Hg in Canada and the United States among men and women combined who were 35 to 74 years of age. This difference already existed among younger persons (35-39 years) in whom treatment was uncommon (ie, 124/78 mm Hg and 115/75 mm Hg, respectively), and the slope with age was steeper in the European countries. For all age groups, BP measurements were lowest in the United States and highest in Germany. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 28{\%} in the North American countries and 44{\%} in the European countries at the 140/90 mm Hg threshold. The findings for men and women by region were similar. Hypertension prevalence was strongly correlated with stroke mortality (r=0.78) and more modestly with total CVD (r=0.44). Conclusions: Despite extensive research on geographic patterns of CVD, the 60{\%} higher prevalence of hypertension in Europe compared with the United States and Canada has not been generally appreciated. The implication of this finding for national prevention strategies should be vigorously explored.},

abstract = {Background Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19.1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127.0 mm Hg (95{\%} credible interval 125.7-128.3) in men and 122.3 mm Hg (121.0-123.6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78.7 mm Hg (77.9-79.5) for men and 76.7 mm Hg (75.9-77.6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24.1{\%} (21.4-27.1) in men and 20.1{\%} (17.8-22.5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

abstract = {The rise in blood pressure with age is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Age-related increases in blood pressure have been observed in almost every population, except among hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. Here we tested for age-related increases in blood pressure among Tsimane forager-farmers. We also test whether lifestyle changes associated with modernization lead to higher blood pressure and a greater rate of age-related increase in blood pressure. We measured blood pressure longitudinally on 2248 adults age ≥20 years (n=6468 observations over 8 years). Prevalence of hypertension was 3.9{\%} for women and 5.2{\%} for men, although diagnosis of persistent hypertension based on multiple observations reduced prevalence to 2.9{\%} for both sexes. Mixed-effects models revealed systolic, diastolic, and pulse blood pressure increases of 2.86 (P{\textless}0.001), 0.95 (P{\textless}0.001), and 1.95 mmHg (P{\textless}0.001) per decade for women and 0.91 (P{\textless}0.001), 0.93 (P{\textless}0.001), and -0.02 mmHg (P=0.93) for men, substantially lower than rates found elsewhere. Lifestyle factors, such as smoking and Spanish fluency, had minimal effect on mean blood pressure and no effect on age-related increases in blood pressure. Greater town proximity was associated with a lower age-related increase in pulse pressure. Effects of modernization were, therefore, deemed minimal among Tsimane, in light of their lean physique, active lifestyle, and protective diet. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Observational and interventional studies have unequivocally demonstrated that “present”, i.e. single-occasion, blood pressure is one of the key determinants of cardiovascular disease risk. Over the past two decades, however, numerous publications have suggested that longitudinal blood pressure data and assessment of long-term blood pressure exposure provide incremental prognostic value over present blood pressure. These studies have used several different indices to quantify the overall exposure to blood pressure, such as time-averaged blood pressure, cumulative blood pressure, blood pressure trajectory patterns, and age of hypertension onset. This review summarises existing research on the association between these indices and hard cardiovascular outcomes, outlines the strengths and weaknesses of these indices, and provides an overview of how longitudinal blood pressure changes can be measured and used to improve cardiovascular disease risk prediction.KEY MESSAGES Numerous recent publications have examined the relation between cardiovascular disease and long-term blood pressure (BP) exposure, quantified using indices such as time-averaged BP, cumulative BP, BP trajectory patterns, and age of hypertension onset. This review summarises existing research on the association between these indices and hard cardiovascular outcomes, outlines the strengths and weaknesses of these indices, and provides an overview of how longitudinal BP changes can be measured and used to improve cardiovascular disease risk prediction. Although longitudinal BP indices seem to predict cardiovascular outcomes better than present BP, there are considerable differences in the clinical feasibility of these indices along with a limited number of prospective data.},

abstract = {Background: We applied a new logistic curve fitting procedure to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) recordings to determine whether the rate of increase in systolic (SBP), mean (MBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) in the morning is related to the level of BP in subjects. Methods: The rate of transition in the morning and evening period was determined using a six-parameter double-logistic equation applied to 528 ABP recordings from a cardiovascular risk assessment clinic. Based on daytime BP (MBP, SBP, or DBP), the upper quartile (UQ, n = 132) and lower quartile (LQ) were compared. Results: Subjects in the UQ of daytime MBP were hypertensive and showed greater day-night differences compared to normotensive subjects in the LQ (29 ± 1 mm Hg for MBP compared to 20 ± 1 mm Hg). The rate of morning increase in SBP and DBP was 42{\%} and 30{\%} greater in UQ subjects compared to the LQ subjects (P {\textless} .05). The rates of evening decrease in all BPs were 69{\%} to 84{\%} greater in the subjects in the UQ. Similar results were obtained if subjects were divided according to daytime SBP or DBP. The rate of morning increase in MBP was correlated with daytime BP, but not night-time or 24 h MBP. Conclusions: The rate of morning increase in BP is greater in those subjects with the highest daytime BP. The exaggerated rate of morning increase in BP in this group, which were all hypertensive, may also be important for greater cardiovascular risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) fluctuates throughout the day. The pattern it follows represents one of the most important circadian rhythms in the human body. For example, morning BP surge has been suggested as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular events occurring in the morning, but the accurate quantification of this phenomenon remains a challenge. Here, we outline a novel method to quantify morning surge. We demonstrate how the most commonly used method to model 24-hour BP, the single cosinor approach, can be extended to a multiple-component cosinor random-effects model. We outline how this model can be used to obtain a measure of morning BP surge by obtaining derivatives of the model fit. The model is compared with a functional principal component analysis that determines the main components of variability in the data. Data from the Mitchelstown Study, a population-based study of Irish adults (n = 2047), were used where a subsample (1207) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We demonstrate that our 2-component model provided a significant improvement in fit compared with a single model and a similar fit to a more complex model captured by b-splines using functional principal component analysis. The estimate of the average maximum slope was 2.857 mmHg/30 min (bootstrap estimates; 95{\%} CI: 2.855-2.858 mmHg/30 min). Simulation results allowed us to quantify the between-individual SD in maximum slopes, which was 1.02 mmHg/30 min. By obtaining derivatives we have demonstrated a novel approach to quantify morning BP surge and its variation between individuals. This is the first demonstration of cosinor approach to obtain a measure of morning surge.},

abstract = {Patients with kidney replacement exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms. Most studies measuring blood pressure use the dipper/non-dipper classification, which does not consider analysis of transitional stages between low and high blood pressure, confidence intervals nor shifts in the time of peak, while assuming subjective onsets of night and day phases. In order to better understand the nature of daily variation of blood pressure in these patients, we analyzed 24 h recordings from 41 renal transplant recipients using the non-symmetrical double-logistic fitting assessment which does not assume abruptness nor symmetry in ascending and descending stages of the blood pressure profile, and a cosine best-fitting regression method (Cosinor). Compared with matched controls, double-logistic fitting showed that the times for most transitional stages (ascending systolic and descending systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure) had a wider distribution along the 24-h. The proportion of individuals without daily blood pressure rhythm in the transplanted group was larger only for systolic arterial pressure, and the amplitude showed no significant difference. Furthermore, the transplant recipient group had a less pronounced slope in descending systolic and ascending mean blood pressure. Cosinor analysis confirmed this phase-related changes, showing a wider distribution of times of peak (acrophases). We conclude that daily disruptions in renal transplant recipients can be explained not necessarily by an absence in diurnal variation, but also by changes in waveform-related parameters of the rhythm, and that alterations in the phase of the rhythm are the most consistent finding in these patients.},

abstract = {The global health burden presented by hypertension is providing increased motivation for improved means of collection of blood pressure (BP) data. A growing area of research and commercial activity is the use of wearable devices to provide BP data using non-invasive cuffless techniques. The accelerated progress in recent years, particularly relating to connectivity of smartphone technology, has promoted the availability of consumer devices that provide values of BP. The main types of devices are wrist-worn, watch-type devices with sensors that typically record a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, sometimes also with an electrocardiography (ECG) signal. The general underlying concept of the cuffless BP measurement in most device types is the association of BP and the travel time of the arterial pulse between two locations, determined from the time delay between the ECG and PPG signals. Other methods may involve additional analysis of the PPG waveform features. Experimental data are presented to illustrate the challenges presented by cuffless BP techniques in obtaining reliable BP measurements when the change in BP is caused by different stimuli affecting cardiac and vascular mechanisms. These effects influence the association of the measured and physiological BP change, thus presenting significant challenges and potential limitations in the use of cuffless BP devices for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.},

abstract = {One in three adults worldwide has hypertension, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is a global demand for continuous and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements that are convenient, easy to use, and more accurate than the currently available methods for detecting hypertension. This could easily be achieved through the integration of single-site photoplethysmography (PPG) readings into wearable devices, although improved reliability and an understanding of BP estimation accuracy are essential. This review paper focuses on understanding the features of PPG associated with BP and examines the development of this technology over the 2010–2019 period in terms of validation, sample size, diversity of subjects, and datasets used. Challenges and opportunities to move single-site PPG forward are also discussed.},

abstract = {Objective: Continuous blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for the disease management of patients with arrhythmias. The traditional intra-arterial method is too invasive for routine healthcare settings, whereas cuff-based devices are inferior in reliability and comfortable for long-term BP monitoring during arrhythmias. The study aimed to investigate an indirect method for continuous and cuff-less BP estimation based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during arrhythmias and to test its reliability for the determination of BP using invasive BP (IBP) as reference. Methods: Thirty-five clinically stable patients (15 with ventricular arrhythmias and 20 with supraventricular arrhythmias) who had undergone radiofrequency ablation were enrolled in this study. Their ECG, PPG, and femoral arterial IBP signals were simultaneously recorded with a multi-parameter monitoring system. Fifteen features that have the potential ability in indicating beat-to-beat BP changes during arrhythmias were extracted from the ECG and PPG signals. Four machine learning algorithms, decision tree regression (DTR), support vector machine regression (SVR), adaptive boosting regression (AdaboostR), and random forest regression (RFR), were then implemented to develop the BP models. Results: The results showed that the mean value ± standard deviation of root mean square error for the estimated systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were 5.87 ± 3.13 and 3.52 ± 1.38 mmHg, respectively, which achieved the best performance among all the models. Furthermore, the mean error ± standard deviation of error between the estimated SBP and DBP with the RFR model against the reference in all patients were −0.04 ± 6.11 and 0.11 ± 3.62 mmHg, respectively, which complied with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and the British Hypertension Society (Grade A) standards. Conclusion: The results indicated that the utilization of ECG and PPG signals has the potential to enable cuff-less and continuous BP estimation in an indirect way for patients with arrhythmias.},

Despite the support for this perspective, one of the basic hypotheses - the mediation of these effects by beta-adrenergic activity - has not been tested yet. To close this gap, participants worked on a delayed-matching-to-sample task and could earn either 1, 15, or 30 Swiss Francs for a successful performance. Results showed that preejection period reactivity - an indicator of beta-adrenergic impact on the heart - increased with increasing incentive value. Thus, this experiment closes a gap in the support of Wright's model by demonstrating that beta-adrenergic reactivity is associated with incentive value under conditions of unclear difficulty.

abstract = {Respiratory rate (RR) is an important vital sign which can be difficult to measure accurately and unobtrusively in routine clinical practice. Pulse transit time (PTT), on the other hand, is unobtrusive to collect from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Using PTT is a novel method to estimate and monitor blood pressure (BP) and RR. This study aimed to estimate continuous RR using PTT with singular spectrum analysis to extract respiratory components. The performance of this method was validated on 17 subjects who carried out spontaneous breathing and controlled deep breathing conditions. Three types of estimated RR parameters (average RR by power spectral density (PSD) (RRPSD), number of breaths (RR{\#}), and instantaneous RR (RRinst)) were compared with the corresponding reference RR. The reference RR was collected using a respiratory belt. Our findings demonstrate that the PTT signal reliably tracked respiratory variation with a root mean square error of 0.84, 1.11, and 0.74 breaths/min for RRPSD, RR{\#}, and RRinst estimations, respectively. Overall, RR estimated by PTT was more accurate than heart/pulse rate interval, QRS area, and PPG amplitude, which were also extracted from ECG and PPG. The results suggest that it may be feasible to use PTT as an estimation of RR and that ECG and PPG may be relied upon for monitoring not only RR but also BP and heart rate.},

abstract = {A novel method for the continual, cuff-less estimation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values based on signal complexity analysis of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is reported. The proposed framework estimates the blood pressure (BP) values obtained from signals generated from 14 volunteers subjected to a series of exercise routines. Herein, the physiological signals were first pre-processed, followed by the extraction of complexity features from both the PPG and ECG. Subsequently the complexity features were used in regression models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and LASSO) to predict the BP. The performance of the approach was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error and the standard deviation of the predicted results and compared with the recommendations made by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Complexity features from the ECG and PPG were investigated independently, along with the combined dataset. It was observed that the complexity features obtained from the combination of ECG and PPG signals resulted to an improved estimation accuracy for the BP. The most accurate DBP result of 5.15 ± 6.46 mmHg was obtained from ANN model, and SVM generated the most accurate prediction for the SBP which was estimated as 7.33 ± 9.53 mmHg. Results for DBP fall within recommended performance of the BHS but SBP is outside the range. Although initial results are promising, further improvements are required before the potential of this approach is fully realised.},

abstract = {Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive technique for evaluation of cardiac hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output and pre-ejection period. However, the sensitivity of the technique to motion artifact, electrode displacement, and cardiovascular pathologies can severely impact the accuracy of hemodynamic parameter estimates. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm for the automatic detection and exclusion of corrupted ICG cardiac cycles by defining a pulse similarity index that quantifies the level of pulse corruption and its diversion from a typical-shaped pulse. The index considers different features (activity, structure, shape, and pattern) of the ICG cardiac cycles. The algorithm is compared on sleep data collected from 20 participants against expert identified corrupted cycles. The artifact rejection algorithm achieved a high accuracy of 96{\%} in detection of expert-identified corrupted ICG cycles, including those with normal amplitude as well as out-of-range values, and was robust to different types and levels of artifact. The algorithm shows promise toward applications requiring accurate and reliable automatic measurement of cardiac hemodynamic parameters from prolonged data sets.},

abstract = {The preejection period (PEP) is an index of left ventricle contractility widely used in psychophysiological research. Its computation requires detecting the moment when the aortic valve opens, which coincides with the B point in the first derivative of impedance cardiogram (ICG). Although this operation has been traditionally made via visual inspection, several algorithms based on derivative calculations have been developed to enable an automatic performance of the task. However, despite their popularity, data about their empirical validation are not always available. The present study analyzes the performance in the estimation of the aortic valve opening of three popular algorithms, by comparing their performance with the visual detection of the B point made by two independent scorers. Algorithm 1 is based on the first derivative of the ICG, Algorithm 2 on the second derivative, and Algorithm 3 on the third derivative. Algorithm 3 showed the highest accuracy rate (78.77{\%}), followed by Algorithm 1 (24.57{\%}) and Algorithm 2 (13.82{\%}). In the automatic computation of PEP, Algorithm 2 resulted in significantly more missed cycles (48.57{\%}) than Algorithm 1 (6.3{\%}) and Algorithm 3 (3.5{\%}). Algorithm 2 also estimated a significantly lower average PEP (70 ms), compared with the values obtained by Algorithm 1 (119 ms) and Algorithm 3 (113 ms). Our findings indicate that the algorithm based on the third derivative of the ICG performs significantly better. Nevertheless, a visual inspection of the signal proves indispensable, and this article provides a novel visual guide to facilitate the manual detection of the B point.},

B-point detection accuracy can be severely impacted if ICG cardiac cycles corrupted by motion artifact, noise, or electrode displacement are included in the analyses. Here, we developed new algorithms to detect and exclude corrupted ICG cycles by analyzing their level of activity. PEP was then estimated and analyzed on ensemble-averaged clean ICG cycles using an automatic algorithm previously developed by the authors for the detection of B point in awake individuals. We investigated the algorithms' performance relative to expert visual scoring on long-duration data collected from 20 participants during overnight recordings, where the quality of ICG could be highly affected by movement artifacts and electrode displacements and the signal could also vary according to sleep stage and time of night. The artifact rejection algorithm achieved a high accuracy of 87{\%} in detection of expert-identified corrupted ICG cycles, including those with normal amplitude as well as out-of-range values, and was robust to different types and levels of artifact. Intraclass correlations for concurrent validity of the B-point detection algorithm in different sleep stages and in-bed wakefulness exceeded 0.98, indicating excellent agreement with the expert.

abstract = {Impedance cardiography is the most common clinically validated, noninvasive method for determining the timing of the opening of the aortic valve, an important event used for measuring preejection period, which reflects sympathetic beta-adrenergic influences on the heart. Automatic detection of the exact time of the opening of the aortic valve (B point on the impedance cardiogram) has proven to be challenging as its appearance varies between and within individuals and may manifest as a reversal, inflection, or rapid slope change of the thoracic impedance derivative's (dZ/dt) rapid rise. Here, a novel automatic algorithm is proposed for the detection of the B point by finding the main rapid rise of the dZ/dt signal, which is due to blood ejection. Several conditions based on zero crossings, minima, and maxima of the dZ/dt signal and its derivatives are considered to reject any unwanted noise and artifacts and select the true B-point location. The detected B-point locations are then corrected by modeling the B-point time data using forward and reverse autoregressive models. The proposed algorithm is validated against expert-detected B points and is compared with different conventional methods; it significantly outperforms them by at least 54{\%} in mean error, 30{\%} in mean absolute error, and 27{\%} in standard deviation of error. This algorithm can be adopted in ambulatory studies requiring beat-to-beat evaluation of cardiac hemodynamic parameters over extended time periods where expert scoring is not feasible.},

abstract = {Background and objective: Blood pressure (BP) is one of the four vital signals that provides valuable medical information about the cardiovascular activity. In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted on non-invasive and cuff-less BP estimation using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG is a non-invasive optical method for measuring blood volume changes per pulse. In other words, the PPG waveform represents the mechanical activity of the heart. Methods: In this paper, a new method for estimating the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is proposed using only the PPG signal regardless of its shape (appropriate or inappropriate). Our proposed algorithm called whole-based, uses raw values of the PPG signal at a given time interval for estimating the BP. In other algorithms called parameter-based, use features which are extracted from PPG signals in time or frequency domain. These features related to precise spotting in the form of the PPG signal. In fact, compared to parameter-based methods, our algorithm is independent of the form of the PPG signal. Results: Using the proposed algorithm, our results are completely met by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for both MAP and DBP estimations. The results are also very close to the standard boundary with an average error close to zero for SBP estimation. Also, according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, the proposed algorithm for DBP estimation got grade A, whereas it got grade B for estimation of MAP and got approximately grade C for SBP estimation. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in estimating BP noninvasively, cuff-less, calibration-free, and only by using the appropriate or inappropriate PPG signal.},

abstract = {Because a real-time monitoring using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenging task, the preprocessing techniques used for ECG signal analysis are crucial for obtaining information that is further used for some more complex analysis, such as predictive analyses. We compared different settings of parameters needed for pre-processing of ECG signals in order to estimate the valuable information that can be further used for blood pressure classification. Two parameters were involved in the comparison: i) the signal length used for ECG segmentation; and ii) the cut-off frequency used for baseline removal. The first parameter is the parameter used for obtaining ECG segments that are further used, and the second one is the frequency used for baseline removal. Thirty different combinations, each a combination of a signal length and a cut-off frequency, were evaluated using a dataset that contains data from five commercially available ECG sensors. For signal lengths: 10 s, 20 s, and 30 s, were used for data segmentation, while the cut-off frequency for baseline removal starts from 0.05 Hz, till 0.50 Hz, with a step length of 0.05 Hz. The evaluation of these combinations was done in combination with complexity analysis used for features extraction that are further used for blood pressure classification. Experimental results, obtained using a data-driven approach by comparing the combinations using the results obtained from the classification for 17 performance measures, showed that a signal length of 30 s carries the most information in a combination with cut-off frequency between 0.10 Hz and 0.20 Hz. Results contribute to the arguments published in the literature discussing the optimal ECG sample lengths needed for building predictive models, as well as the lower frequencies where the ECG components overlap with the baseline wander noise.},

Blood pressure (BP), as the output of the heart's activity, is one of the important physiological parameters of the human body. It is demonstrated that there is a complex nonlinear relationship between the ECG signal and BP. The continuous measurement of BP can avail early detection, control and treatment of BP related diseases. To reduce difficulties and adverse effects of the traditional methods of BP measurement techniques which use a cuff, the research on cuff-less BP estimation is of significant interest in the community. This paper presents a new feature extraction algorithm based on McSharry's ECG signal dynamical modeling for estimating BP using only the ECG signal. In fact, this feature vector is formed using the morphology of the ECG signal. The proposed method, utilizing data mining techniques, achieved 1.125 mmHg for mean error and 3.125 mmHg for standard deviation of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP).},

The hypothesis set in the paper is that blood pressure is related to electrocardiogram (ECG) and that the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values can be predicted by using information only from a given ECG signal. Therefore, we established a protocol for creating a database considering measurements from real patients in ambulance environment, and consequently developed methodology for analysing the collected measurements. The proposed methodology follows two steps: i) first the signals are considered as time series data, and ii) a time series feature extraction method is applied to extract the important features from the ECG signals. Hereafter, a novel Machine learning method is applied (CLUS) that produced best results among the traditionally-used Machine learning methods. The best results obtained are 12.81 ± 2.66 mmHg for SBP and 8.12 ± 1.80 mmHg for DBP. After introducing calibration method the obtained mean absolute errors (MAEs) reduced to 6.93 ± 4.70 mmHg for SBP, and 7.13 ± 4.48 mmHg for DBP. Given the latest literature, the results are appropriately compared and confirm the relation between the ECG signal and the blood pressure.},

abstract = {During blood pressure (BP) measurement, the recommended positioning of the cuff bladder center is directly above the brachial artery. We investigated the relevance of incorrect cuff positioning during (1) auscultatory measurement with an appropriate or improperly small cuff and (2) oscillometric measurement with a wide-range cuff designed to guarantee accurate measurements regardless of position. In subjects with wide BP and arm circumference ranges, (1) auscultatory BP was repeatedly measured with a properly positioned cuff (reference) and, simultaneously, with an identical cuff placed on the other arm in either a correct or an incorrect position (test). The measurements were performed with a properly sized (N=57) or an improperly small cuff (N=33). (2) Auscultatory measurements obtained with a properly positioned and sized cuff were compared with oscillometric measurements obtained with a specially designed wide-range cuff (Omron IntelliWrap) placed on the contralateral arm either in a correct or an incorrect position. Auscultatory BP measures were unaffected by incorrect positioning of a properly sized cuff, whereas with undercuffing, BP was overestimated with the cuff displaced by 90° laterally (systolic/diastolic BP differences: 4.9±4.6/4.0±4.6 mm Hg, P{\textless}0.01) or by 180° (3.9±5.4/4.2±5.1 mm Hg, P{\textless}0.01) in relation to the correct position. Incorrect placement of the oscillometric cuff had no significant effect on the accuracy of the measurements (difference with correct position {\textless}1.5 mm Hg). Incorrect cuff positioning introduces a systematic overestimation of auscultatory BP when the cuff is too small in relation to arm circumference but not when it is correctly sized. No systematic error was observed with oscillometric measurements obtained with a specially designed wide-range cuff.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data recorded from the devices used to monitor a patient's vital signs are often used in the development of displays, alarms, and information systems, but high-resolution, multiple-parameter datasets of anesthesia monitoring data from patients during anesthesia are often difficult to obtain. Existing databases have typically been collected from patients in intensive care units. However, the physical state of intensive care patients is dissimilar to those undergoing surgery, more frequent and marked changes to cardiovascular and respiratory variables are seen in operating room patients, and additional and highly relevant information to anesthesia (e.g., end-tidal agent monitoring, etc.) is omitted from these intensive care databases. We collected a set of high-quality, high-resolution, multiple-parameter monitoring data suitable for anesthesia monitoring research. METHODS: Vital signs data were recorded from patients undergoing anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Software was developed to capture, time synchronize, and interpolate vital signs data from Philips IntelliVue MP70 and MP30 patient monitors and Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva/5 anesthesia machines into 10 millisecond resolution samples. The recorded data were saved in a variety of accessible file formats. RESULTS: Monitoring data were recorded from 32 cases (25 general anesthetics, 3 spinal anesthetics, 4 sedations) ranging in duration from 13 minutes to 5 hours (median 105 min). Most cases included data from the electrocardiograph, pulse oximeter, capnograph, noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitor, airway flow, and pressure monitor and, in a few cases, the Y-piece spirometer, electroencephalogram monitor, and arterial blood pressure monitor. Recorded data were processed and saved into 4 file formats: (1) comma-separated values text files with full numerical and waveform data, (2) numerical parameters recorded in comma-separated values files at 1-second intervals, (3) graphical plots of all waveform data in a range of resolutions as Portable Network Graphics image files, and (4) graphical overview plots of numerical data for entire cases as Portable Network Graphics and Scalable Vector Graphics files. The complete dataset is freely available online via doi:102.100.100/6914 and has been listed in the Australian National Data Service Collections Registry. DISCUSSION: The present dataset provides clinical anesthesia monitoring data from entire surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia, includes a wide range of vital signs variables that are commonly monitored during surgery, and is published in accessible, user-friendly file formats. The text and image file formats let researchers without engineering or computer science backgrounds easily access the data using standard spreadsheet and image browsing software. In future work, monitoring data should be collected from a wider range and larger number of cases, and software tools are needed to support searching and navigating the database. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Anesthesia Research Society.},

Methods.—Sixty-seven normotensive subjects and 171 borderline, 309 mild, 140 moderate, and 41 severe hypertensive patients were studied with noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring. Each subject was assigned a target organ damage score of 0 to 5 on the basis of funduscopic changes and degree of left ventricular hypertrophy calculated from electrocardiogram and chest roentgenogram. Results.—When the 728 subjects were subdivided into five classes of increasing daytime BP, in each class a significantly higher degree of target organ damage was present in the subjects with higher nighttime diastolic BP. A similar, although nonsignificant, trend was observed in the subjects with higher nighttime systolic BP. In particular, higher night-time BP levels were accompanied by a more severe degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. As for variability, subjects with higher daytime systolic BP SD, but not with higher day-time diastolic SD, displayed a more severe degree of target organ damage; this was accounted for by a higher degree of retinal abnormalities. The association between target organ damage and systolic BP SD was present both in men and women, while that with nighttime BP was present only in men. No relationship was found between degree of cardiovascular complications and peaks of pressure. Conclusions.—These results suggest that a reduced day-night BP difference and an increased daytime BP variability, evaluated as the SD, are associated with a higher degree of hypertensive cardiovascular complications. Whether this BP profile is the cause or the consequence of target organ damage remains to be established. {\textcopyright} 1992, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in clinical practice and observational epidemiological studies has grown considerably in the past 25 years. ABPM is a very effective technique for assessing biological, environmental, and drug effects on blood pressure. OBJECTIVES: In order to enhance the effectiveness of ABPM for clinical and observational research studies using analytical and graphical results, developing alternative data analysis approaches using modern statistical techniques are important. METHODS: The linear mixed model for the analysis of longitudinal data is particularly well suited for the estimation of, inference about, and interpretation of both population (mean) and subject-specific trajectories for ABPM data. We propose using a linear mixed model with orthonormal polynomials across time in both the fixed and random effects to analyze ABPM data. RESULTS: We demonstrate the proposed analyis technique using data from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study, a multicenter, randomized, parallel arm feeding study that tested the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The linear mixed model is relatively easy to implement (given the complexity of the technique) using available software, allows for straightforward testing of multiple hypotheses, and the results can be presented to research clinicians using both graphical and tabular displays. Using orthonormal polynomials provides the ability to model the nonlinear trajectories of each subject with the same complexity as the mean model (fixed effects). {\textcopyright} 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {We propose a procedure for the detection of multiple outliers in multivariate data. Let X be an n × p data matrix representing n observations on p variates. We first order the n observations, using an appropriately chosen robust measure of outlyingness, then divide the data set into two initial subsets: a `basic' subset which contains p + 1 `good' observations and a `non-basic' subset which contains the remaining n - p - 1 observations. Second, we compute the relative distance from each point in the data set to the centre of the basic subset, relative to the (possibly singular) covariance matrix of the basic subset. Third, we rearrange the n observations in ascending order accordingly, then divide the data set into two subsets: a basic subset which contains the first p + 2 observations and a non-basic subset which contains the remaining n - p - 2 observations. This process is repeated until an appropriately chosen stopping criterion is met. The final non-basic subset of observations is declared an outlying subset. The procedure proposed is illustrated and compared with existing methods by using several data sets. The procedure is simple, computationally inexpensive, suitable for automation, computable with widely available software packages, effective in dealing with masking and swamping problems and, most importantly, successful in identifying multivariate outliers.

abstract = {Objective: In the critically ill, blood pressure measurements mostly rely on automated oscillometric devices pending the intra-arterial catheter insertion or after its removal. If the arms are inaccessible, the cuff is placed at the ankle or the thigh, but this common practice has never been assessed. We evaluated the reliability of noninvasive blood pressure readings at these anatomic sites. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Medical-surgical intensive care unit. Patients: Patients carrying an arterial line with no severe occlusive arterial disease. INTERVENTION:: Each patient underwent a set of three pairs of noninvasive and intra-arterial measurements at each site (arm, ankle, thigh [if Ramsay sedation scale {\textgreater}4]) and, in case of circulatory failure, a second set of measurements after a cardiovascular intervention (volume expansion, change in catecholamine dosage). Measurements and Main Results: In 150 patients, whatever the cuff site, the agreement between invasive and noninvasive readings was markedly higher for mean arterial pressure than for systolic or diastolic pressure. For mean arterial pressure measurement, arm noninvasive blood pressure was reliable (mean bias of 3.4 ± 5.0 mm Hg, lower/upper limit of agreement of-6.3/13.1 mm Hg) contrary to ankle or thigh noninvasive blood pressure (mean bias of 3.1 ± 7.7 mm Hg and 5.7 ± 6.8 mm Hg and lower/upper limits of agreement of-12.1/18.3 mm Hg and-7.7/19.2 mm Hg, respectively). During acute circulatory failure (n = 83), arm noninvasive blood pressure but also ankle and thigh noninvasive blood pressure allowed a reliable detection of 1) invasive mean arterial pressure {\textless}65 mm Hg (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 [0.92-1], 0.93 [0.85-0.97], and 0.93 [0.85-0.98] for arm, ankle, and thigh noninvasive blood pressure, respectively); and 2) a significant ({\textgreater}10{\%}) increase in invasive mean arterial pressure after a cardiovascular intervention (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 [0.92-1], 0.90 [0.80-0.97], and 0.96 [0.87-0.99], respectively). Conclusion: In our population, arm noninvasive mean arterial pressure readings were accurate. Either the ankle or the thigh may be reliable alternatives, only to detect hypotensive and therapy-responding patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Although its reliability is often questioned, noninvasive BP (NIBP)-monitoring with an oscillometric arm cuff is widely used, even in critically ill patients in shock. When correctly implemented, modern arm NIBP devices can provide accurate and precise measurements of mean BP, as well as clinically meaningful information such as identification of hypotension and hypertension and monitoring of patient response to therapy. Even in specific circumstances such as arrhythmia, hypotension, vasopressor infusion, and possibly in obese patients, arm NIBP may be useful, contrary to widespread belief. Hence, postponing the arterial catheter insertion pending the initiation of more urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures could be a suitable strategy. Given the arterial catheter-related burden, fully managing critically ill patients without any arterial catheter may also be an option. Indeed, the benefit that patients may experience from an arterial catheter has been questioned in studies failing to show that its use reduces mortality. However, randomized controlled trials to confirm that NIBP can safely fully replace the arterial catheter have yet to be performed. In addition to intermittent measurements, continuous NIBP monitoring is a booming field, as illustrated by the release onto the market of user-friendly devices, based on digital volume clamp and applanation tonometry. Although the imperfect accuracy and precision of these devices would probably benefit from technical refinements, their good ability to track, in real time, the direction of changes in BP is an undeniable asset. Their drawbacks and advantages and whether these devices are currently ready to use in the critically ill patient are discussed in this review.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a vital sign and the essential measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension. Therefore, its accurate measurement is a key element for the evaluation of many medical conditions and for the reliable diagnosis and efficient treatment of hypertension. In the last 3 decades prestigious organizations, such as the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the British Hypertension Society, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Working Group on BP Monitoring, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have developed protocols for clinical validation of BP measuring devices. All these initiatives aim to standardize validation procedures and establish minimum accuracy standards for BP monitors. Unfortunately, only a few of the BP measuring devices available on the market have been subjected to independent validation using one of these protocols. Recently, the AAMI, ESH, and ISO experts agreed to develop a single universally acceptable standard (AAMI/ESH/ISO), which will replace all previous protocols. This major international initiative has been undertaken to best serve the needs of patients with hypertension, a public interested in cardiovascular health, practicing physicians, scientific researchers, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers. There is an urgent need to influence regulatory authorities throughout the world to make it mandatory for all BP measuring devices to have undergone independent validation before approval for marketing. Efforts need to be intensified to improve the accuracy of BP measuring devices, further optimize the validation procedure, and ensure that objective and unbiased validation data become available.},

Fourteen patients who underwent cardiac catheterization were included in this study The change of each variable was estimated by the differences between values just before and at three minutes after GTN. After administration of GTN, SBP was significantly decreased from 158 ±21 to 138 ±12 mmHg (P {\textless} 0.01). AC was significantly increased, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, CO, and SV were significantly decreased. The change in SBP was inversely correlated with the change in AC and positively correlated with the change in CO or SV The authors conclude that the mechanism for decrease in SBP by GTN is associated with both an increase in AC and a decrease in venous return. {\textcopyright} 1995, Sage Publications.

abstract = {Physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often severely corrupted by noise, artifact and missing data, which lead to large errors in the estimation of the heart rate (HR) and ABP. A robust HR estimation method is described that compensates for these problems. The method is based upon the concept of fusing multiple signal quality indices (SQIs) and HR estimates derived from multiple electrocardiogram (ECG) leads and an invasive ABP waveform recorded from ICU patients. Physiological SQIs were obtained by analyzing the statistical characteristics of each waveform and their relationships to each other. HR estimates from the ECG and ABP are tracked with separate Kalman filters, using a modified update sequence based upon the individual SQIs. Data fusion of each HR estimate was then performed by weighting each estimate by the Kalman filters' SQI-modified innovations. This method was evaluated on over 6000 h of simultaneously acquired ECG and ABP from a 437 patient subset of ICU data by adding real ECG and realistic artificial ABP noise. The method provides an accurate HR estimate even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during episodes of extreme bradycardia and tachycardia. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Results demonstrate that after the removal ofobvious artifactual derived HR and ABP estimates, the two measurement sources disagree, on average, by a clinically insignificant amount. Furthermore, after rejection of data using signal quality metrics, the error distribution curve significantly tightens. The clinically-verified BP values exhibit a small but significant bias towards overestimation, both as a function of time of day and as a function of day of the week. Differences in values between time ofday and day ofweek were small but statistically significant. Inter-nurse differences are also described.},

abstract = {Introduction: Photoplethysmography (PPG) has been widely used to assess cardiovascular function. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated the effect of measurement site on PPG waveform characteristics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative comparison on this. Methods: Thirty six healthy subjects participated in this study. For each subject, PPG signals were sequentially recorded for 1 min from six different body sites (finger, wrist under (anatomically volar), wrist upper (dorsal), arm, earlobe, and forehead) under both normal and deep breathing patterns. For each body site under a certain breathing pattern, the mean amplitude was firstly derived from recorded PPG waveform which was then normalized to derive several waveform characteristics including the pulse peak time (Tp), dicrotic notch time (Tn), and the reflection index (RI). The effects of breathing pattern and measurement site on the waveform characteristics were finally investigated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc multiple comparisons. Results: Under both breathing patterns, the PPG measurements from the finger achieved the highest percentage of analyzable waveforms for extracting waveform characteristics. There were significant effects of breathing pattern on Tn and RI (larger Tn and smaller RI with deep breathing on average, both p {\textless} 0.03). The effects of measurement site on mean amplitude, Tp, Tn, and RI were significant (all p {\textless} 0.001). The key results were that, under both breathing patterns, the mean amplitude from finger PPG was significantly larger and its Tp and RI were significantly smaller than those from the other five sites (all p {\textless} 0.001, except p = 0.04 for the Tp of “wrist under”), and Tn was only significantly larger than that from the earlobe (both p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: This study has quantitatively confirmed the effect of PPG measurement site on PPG waveform characteristics (including mean amplitude, Tp, Tn, and RI), providing scientific evidence for a better understanding of the PPG waveform variations between different body sites.},

This pregnancy-associated blunting of plasma cortisol excursion was indicated by a significant reduction in the: (1) mean peak and nadir excursion, (2) integrated area between the percent deviation curve and the 24-hour mean, and (3) mean slope of the major incremental and decremental segments of the percent deviation curve. The circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol were reflected in urinary free corticoid values. Mean 24-hour urinary free corticoid concentrations increased 180{\%} during gestation over nonpregnant levels. Nadir concentrations of urinary free corticoids in pregnancy exceeded peak nonpregnant levels. The gestational rise of metabolically active free cortisol and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and the pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of plasma cortisol may be explained by an autonomous source of ACTH during gestation. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need for fast and accurate transfer of readings from blood glucose metres and blood pressure monitors to a smartphone mHealth application, without a dependency on Bluetooth technology. Most of the medical devices recommended for home monitoring use a seven-segment display to show the recorded measurement to the patient. We aimed to achieve accurate detection and reading of the seven-segment digits displayed on these medical devices using an image taken in a realistic scenario by a smartphone camera. A synthetic dataset of seven-segment digits was developed in order to train and test a digit classifier. A dataset containing realistic images of blood glucose metres and blood pressure monitors using a variety of smartphone cameras was also created. The digit classifier was evaluated on a dataset of seven-segment digits manually extracted from the medical device images. These datasets along with the code for its development have been made public. The developed algorithm first preprocessed the input image using retinex with two bilateral filters and adaptive histogram equalisation. Subsequently, the digit segments were automatically located within the image by two techniques operating in parallel: Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) and connected components of a binarised image. A filtering and clustering algorithm was then designed to combine digit segments to form seven-segment digits. The resulting digits were classified using a Histogram of Orientated Gradients (HOG) feature set and a neural network trained on the synthetic digits. The model achieved 93{\%} accuracy on digits found on the medical devices. The digit location algorithm achieved a F1 score of 0.87 and 0.80 on images of blood glucose metres and blood pressure monitors respectively. Very few assumptions were made of the locations of the digits on the devices so that the proposed algorithm can be easily implemented on new devices.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely available non-invasive optical technique to visualize pressure pulse waves (PWs). Pulse transit time (PTT) is a physiological parameter that is often derived from calculations on ECG and PPG signals and is based on tightly defined characteristics of the PW shape. PPG signals are sensitive to artefacts. Coughing or movement of the subject can affect PW shapes that much that the PWs become unsuitable for further analysis. The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm that automatically and objectively eliminates unsuitable PWs. In order to develop a proper algorithm for eliminating unsuitable PWs, a literature study was conducted. Next, a ‘7Step PW-Filter' algorithm was developed that applies seven criteria to determine whether a PW matches the characteristics required to allow PTT calculation. To validate whether the ‘7Step PW-Filter' eliminates only and all unsuitable PWs, its elimination results were compared to the outcome of manual elimination of unsuitable PWs. The ‘7Step PW-Filter' had a sensitivity of 96.3{\%} and a specificity of 99.3{\%}. The overall accuracy of the ‘7Step PW-Filter' for detection of unsuitable PWs was 99.3{\%}. Compared to manual elimination, using the ‘7Step PW-Filter' reduces PW elimination times from hours to minutes and helps to increase the validity, reliability and reproducibility of PTT data.},

abstract = {The measurement of blood pressure (BP) is critical to the treatment and management of many medical conditions. High blood pressure is associated with many chronic disease conditions, and is a major source of mortality and morbidity around the world. For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals. In this article, we review (i) the state-of-the-art and the literature related to PPG signals collected by pulse oximeters, (ii) various theoretical approaches that have been adopted in PPG BP measurement studies, and (iii) the potential of PPG measurement devices as a wearable application. Past studies on changes in PPG signals and BP are highlighted, and the correlation between PPG signals and BP are discussed. We also review the combined use of features extracted from PPG and other physiological signals in estimating BP. Although the technology is not yet mature, it is anticipated that in the near future, accurate, continuous BP measurements may be available from mobile and wearable devices given their vast potential.},

abstract = {AIMS The Hygia Chronotherapy Trial, conducted within the clinical primary care setting, was designed to test whether bedtime in comparison to usual upon awakening hypertension therapy exerts better cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS In this multicentre, controlled, prospective endpoint trial, 19 084 hypertensive patients (10 614 men/8470 women, 60.5 ± 13.7 years of age) were assigned (1:1) to ingest the entire daily dose of ≥1 hypertension medications at bedtime (n = 9552) or all of them upon awakening (n = 9532). At inclusion and at every scheduled clinic visit (at least annually) throughout follow-up, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed for 48 h. During the 6.3-year median patient follow-up, 1752 participants experienced the primary CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or stroke). Patients of the bedtime, compared with the upon-waking, treatment-time regimen showed significantly lower hazard ratio-adjusted for significant influential characteristics of age, sex, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking, HDL cholesterol, asleep systolic blood pressure (BP) mean, sleep-time relative systolic BP decline, and previous CVD event-of the primary CVD outcome [0.55 (95{\%} CI 0.50-0.61), P {\textless} 0.001] and each of its single components (P {\textless} 0.001 in all cases), i.e. CVD death [0.44 (0.34-0.56)], myocardial infarction [0.66 (0.52-0.84)], coronary revascularization [0.60 (0.47-0.75)], heart failure [0.58 (0.49-0.70)], and stroke [0.51 (0.41-0.63)]. CONCLUSION Routine ingestion by hypertensive patients of ≥1 prescribed BP-lowering medications at bedtime, as opposed to upon waking, results in improved ABP control (significantly enhanced decrease in asleep BP and increased sleep-time relative BP decline, i.e. BP dipping) and, most importantly, markedly diminished occurrence of major CVD events.

We present a novel methodology to assess theoretically these computed indexes and the hemodynamics mechanisms relating them. We created a database of 3,325 virtual healthy adult subjects using a validated one-dimensional model of the arterial hemodynamics, with cardiac and arterial parameters varied within physiological healthy ranges. For each virtual subject, foot-to-foot PWV was computed from numerical pressure waveforms at the same locations where clinical measurements are commonly taken. Our numerical results confirm clinical observations: 1) carotid-femoral PWV is a good indicator of aortic stiffness and correlates well with aortic PWV; 2) brachial-ankle PWV overestimates aortic PWV and is related to the stiffness and geometry of both elastic and muscular arteries; and 3) muscular PWV (carotid-radial, femoral-ankle) does not capture the stiffening of the aorta and should therefore not be used as a surrogate for aortic stiffness. In addition, our analysis highlights that the foot-to-foot PWV algorithm is sensitive to the presence of reflected waves in late diastole, which introduce errors in the PWV estimates. In this study, we have created a database of virtual healthy subjects, which can be used to assess theoretically the efficiency of physiological indexes based on pulse wave analysis.},

The generated set of simulations encloses a wide selection of healthy cases that could be encountered in a clinical study. We applied this new methodology to three different case studies that demonstrate the potential of our new tool, and illustrated each of them with a clinically relevant example: (i) we assessed the accuracy of indexes estimating pulse wave velocity; (ii) we validated and refined an algorithm that computes central blood pressure; and (iii) we investigated theoretical mechanisms behind the augmentation index.

We present a model that accounts for wave propagation in anatomically realistic systemic (including coronary and cerebral) arterial/venous networks, pulmonary arterial/venous networks and portal veins. A lumped parameter (0D) heart model represents cardiac function via a time-varying elastance and source resistance, and accounts for mechanical interactions between heart chambers mediated via pericardial constraint, the atrioventricular septum and atrioventricular plane motion. A non-linear windkessel-like 0D model represents microvascular beds, while specialized 0D models are employed for the hepatic and coronary beds. Model-derived pressure and flow waveforms throughout the circulation are shown to reproduce the characteristic features of published human waveforms. Moreover, wave intensity profiles closely resemble available in vivo profiles. Forward and backward wave intensity is quantified and compared along major arteriovenous paths, providing insights into wave dynamics in all of the major physiological networks. Interactions between cardiac function/mechanics and vascular waves are investigated. The model will be an important resource for studying the mechanics underlying pressure/flow waveforms throughout the circulation, along with global interactions between the heart and vessels under normal and pathological conditions.},

In this work, we study if it is possible to estimate cardiovascular health indices using machine learning approaches. In particular, we carry out theoretical assessment of estimating aortic pulse wave velocity, diastolic and systolic blood pressure and stroke volume using pulse transit/arrival timings derived from photopletyshmography signals. For predictions, we train Gaussian process regression using a database of virtual subjects generated with a cardiovascular simulator. Simulated results provides theoretical assessment of accuracy for predictions of the health indices. For instance, aortic pulse wave velocity can be estimated with a high accuracy (r {\textgreater} 0.9) when photopletyshmography is measured from left carotid artery using a combination of foot-to-foot pulse transmit time and peak location derived for the predictions. Similar accuracy can be reached for diastolic blood pressure, but predictions of systolic blood pressure are less accurate (r {\textgreater} 0.75) and the stroke volume predictions are mostly contributed by heart rate.},

abstract = {Arterial blood pressure waveforms contain rich pathophysiological information; hence receive much attention in cardiovascular health monitoring. To assist computerized analysis, an automatic delineator was proposed for the fiducial points of arterial blood pressure waveforms, namely their onsets, systolic peaks and dicrotic notches. The presented delineator characterizes arterial blood pressure waveforms in a beat-by-beat manner. It firstly seeks the pairs of inflection and zero-crossing points, and then utilizes combinatorial amplitude and interval criteria to select the onset and systolic peak. Once a new beat is settled, the delineator seeks the derivative backward to locate the dicrotic notch in the preceding beat. In a nutshell, the delineator is based on the combinatorial analysis of arterial blood pressure waveforms and their derivatives. Three open databases, with an additional subset database, were utilized for delineator validation and performance evaluation. In terms of beat detection, the delineator achieved an average error rate 1.14{\%}, sensitivity 99.43{\%} and positive predictivity 99.45{\%}. As to dicrotic notch detection, it performed well with an error rate 6.83{\%}, sensitivity 96.53{\%} and positive predictivity 96.64{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the long-term influence of involuntary hospitalization on medication adherence, engagement in out-patient treatment and perceived coercion to treatment participation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In a naturalistic observational multi-centre study, 290 voluntarily and 84 involuntarily hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder had been followed up over a period of 2 years with half-yearly assessments. Assessments included self-rated medication adherence, externally judged medication adherence by blood levels, engagement in treatment and perceived coercion. The statistical analyses were based on multilevel hierarchical modelling of longitudinal data. Level and development of the outcome was controlled for involuntariness, for sociodemographic characteristics and clinical history.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Involuntariness of the index-hospitalization did not have an effect on the development of treatment engagement or medication adherence judged by blood levels in the course of the follow-up period when the models were controlled for sociodemographic variables and clinical history. It was associated, though, with a continuously lower self-rated medication adherence. Moreover, former involuntarily hospitalized patients more often felt coerced in several treatment aspects at the follow-up assessments. Yet, there was no difference between the voluntary and involuntary group with regard to the development of the levels of adherence or coercion experiences over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Involuntary hospitalization does not seem to impair future treatment engagement in patients with schizophrenia, but formerly involuntarily hospitalized patients continue to be more sensitive to subjective or real coercion in their treatment and more vulnerable to medication non-adherence. Hereby, their risk of future involuntary hospitalization might be increased.},

abstract = {Objective: To report a case of ciprofloxacin-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Case Summary: A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presented on 2 separate occasions with generalized weakness. Both times, she was started on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection. Prior to the first episode, she had also been on Augmentin for several days. On both occasions, her ciprofloxacin was discontinued on admission, and her sodium levels rose. On the first occasion, she was given 5{\%} dextrose in water to slow the rate of rise, yet she still corrected faster than the recommended rate. After the second admission, she was briefly given hypertonic saline but remained off intravenous fluids, and her sodium again rose faster than the recommended rate. Discussion: An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo scale was done. A score of 8 revealed a probable causality between ciprofloxacin and SIADH. The likely mechanism of this reaction is ciprofloxacin crossing the blood-brain barrier and stimulating the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which leads to the synthesis and release of antidiuretic hormone. Conclusion: Fluoroquinolones have the potential to cause SIADH. In this case, ciprofloxacin probably caused SIADH. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

There was no significant difference in average mean arterial pressure for the 3 regimens. Fluctuations of mean arterial pressure with time were not significantly different for the regimens as indicated by coefficient of variation. The mean coefficient of variation for the 2 days prior to initiation of hydralazine dosing was 4.0{\%} ± 0.3 (SEM) and for the 3 dosing regimens ranged from 4.1{\%} to 4.8{\%}. Heart rate was used as an index of vasodilator-induced increase in sympathetic tone and therefore as a measure of possible side effects. Fluctuations in heart rate were small and were not associated with symptoms. After discontinuation of hydralazine, the time for blood pressure to return halfway between initial placebo value and end treatment value varied from 30 to 140 hr. A tracer dose of hydralazine-14C {\textperiodcentered} HCl was administered intravenously to the patients. The urinary excretion of 14C showed a multiexponential pattern of elimination with a previously undescribed prolonged terminal phase. Under the conditions of the present study, a daily dose of 300 mg of hydralazine was as effective and free of side effects given in 2 as in 4 divided doses. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {In a contemporary clinical laboratory it is very common to have to assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods. In 1983 Altman and Bland (B{\&}A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement. The B{\&}A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95{\%} of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot. The B{\&}A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals. The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

abstract = {Sepsis is a poorly understood and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur as a result of infection. Early detection and treatment improves patient outcomes, and as such it poses an important challenge in medicine. In this work, we develop a flexible classifier that leverages streaming lab results, vitals, and medications to predict sepsis before it occurs. We model patient clinical time series with multi-output Gaussian processes, maintaining uncertainty about the physiological state of a patient while also imputing missing values. The mean function takes into account the effects of medications administered on the trajectories of the physiological variables. Latent function values from the Gaussian process are then fed into a deep recurrent neural network to classify patient encounters as septic or not, and the overall model is trained end-to-end using back-propagation. We train and validate our model on a large dataset of 18 months of heterogeneous inpatient stays from the Duke University Health System, and develop a new "real-time" validation scheme for simulating the performance of our model as it will actually be used. Our proposed method substantially outperforms clinical baselines, and improves on a previous related model for detecting sepsis. Our model's predictions will be displayed in a real-time analytics dashboard to be used by a sepsis rapid response team to help detect and improve treatment of sepsis.},

abstract = {In the study of various diseases, heterogeneity among patients usually leads to different progression patterns and may require different types of therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is important to study patient subtyping, which is grouping of patients into disease characterizing subtypes. Subtyping from complex patient data is challenging because of the information heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been successfully used in many domains for processing sequential data, and recently applied for analyzing longitudinal patient records. The LSTM units are designed to handle data with constant elapsed times between consecutive elements of a sequence. Given that time lapse between successive elements in patient records can vary from days to months, the design of traditional LSTM may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM unit called Time-Aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to handle irregular time intervals in longitudinal patient records. We learn a subspace decomposition of the cell memory which enables time decay to discount the memory content according to the elapsed time. We propose a patient subtyping model that leverages the proposed T-LSTM in an auto-encoder to learn a powerful single representation for sequential records of patients, which are then used to cluster patients into clinical subtypes. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed T-LSTM architecture captures the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

Motivated by the recent resurgence of Long Short Term Memory networks, we propose a novel end-to-end Bayesian deep model that provides time series prediction along with uncertainty estimation.

abstract = {Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.},

abstract = {A beat-to-beat model of the cardiovascular system is developed to study the spontaneous short-term variability in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data from humans at rest. The model consists of a set of difference equations representing the following mechanisms: 1) control of HR and peripheral resistance by the baroreflex, 2) Windkessel properties of the systematic arterial tree, 3) contractile properties of the myocardium (Starling's law and restitution), and 4) mechanical effects of respiration on BP. The model is tested by comparing power spectra and cross spectra of simulated data from the model with spectra of actual data from resting subjects. The make spectra from simulated data and from actual data tally, it must be assumed that respiratory sinus arrhythmia at rest is caused by the conversion of respiratory BP variability into HR variability by the fast, vagally mediated baroreflex. The so-called 10-s rhythm in HR and BP appears as a resonance phenomenon due to the delay in the sympathetic control loop of the baroreflex. The simulated response of the model to an imposed increase of BP is shown to correspond with the BP and HR response in patients after administration of a BP-increasing drug, such as phenylephrine. It is concluded that the model correctly describes a number of important features of the cardiovascular system. Mathematical properties of the difference-equation model are discussed.},

Methods: We prospectively assessed all individuals presenting with an acute vascular event of any type in any arterial territory irrespective of age in a population of 91 106 in Oxfordshire, UK, in 2002-05. Findings: 2024 acute vascular events occurred in 1657 individuals: 918 (45{\%}) cerebrovascular (618 stroke, 300 transient ischaemic attacks [TIA]); 856 (42{\%}) coronary vascular (159 ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 316 non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 218 unstable angina, 163 sudden cardiac death); 188 (9{\%}) peripheral vascular (43 aortic, 53 embolic visceral or limb ischaemia, 92 critical limb ischaemia); and 62 unclassifiable deaths. Relative incidence of cerebrovascular events compared with coronary events was 1{\textperiodcentered}19 (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}06-1{\textperiodcentered}33) overall; 1{\textperiodcentered}40 (1{\textperiodcentered}23-1{\textperiodcentered}59) for non-fatal events; and 1{\textperiodcentered}21 (1{\textperiodcentered}04-1{\textperiodcentered}41) if TIA and unstable angina were further excluded. Event and incidence rates rose steeply with age in all arterial territories, with 735 (80{\%}) cerebrovascular, 623 (73{\%}) coronary, and 147 (78{\%}) peripheral vascular events in 12 886 (14{\%}) individuals aged 65 years or older; and 503 (54{\%}), 402 (47{\%}), and 105 (56{\%}), respectively, in the 5919 (6{\%}) aged 75 years or older. Although case-fatality rates increased with age, 736 (47{\%}) of 1561 non-fatal events occurred at age 75 years or older. Interpretation: The high rates of acute vascular events outside the coronary arterial territory and the steep rise in event rates with age in all territories have implications for prevention strategies, clinical trial design, and the targeting of funds for service provision and research.},

abstract = {Oscillometric blood pressure measurement has become very popular, but although a number of devices have now passed both the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society criteria, complacency with the state of the technique is as yet premature. In individual subjects, a substantial number of readings may deviate more than a clinically relevant 5 mmHg in devices that have earned a British Hypertension Society grade A rating. The marketing of pressure-wave-simulating devices is a welcome development as monitors can now be tested for reproducibility; an intra-device standard deviation of less than 2 mmHg has been proposed as the limit. Authors suggest that these simulators are currently better suited to intra- than between-device testing since they are not yet fully confident that the simulated waveforms are indistinguishable from the man-made pressure waves. Simulators should, however, be incorporated into our standard validation protocols in order eventually to obviate the human, fallible, factor in the validation protocols. The currently employed maximal amplitude algorithm has many drawbacks as the parameter identification points for systolic and diastolic pressure depend on many factors, for example pulse pressure, heart rate and arterial stiffness. These errors have now been demonstrated in clinical studies. Modern pattern recognition algorithms are being constructed but have not yet produced convincing results. As repeatedly stated, the development of a more robust and more widely applicable algorithm than the maximal amplitude approach should be allocated a high priority. {\textcopyright} 2001 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Objective The influence of the location of the sensor on reflectance pulse oximetry during fetal monitoring in labour was investigated using the newborn infant as a model. Methods Seven healthy infants were studied between 19 and 48 hours after term delivery. Recordings of reflectance pulse oximetry were obtained from eight different sites on the infant's head. The relative changes in red to infrared light (R/IR) were determined. In pulse oximetry R/IR values are converted to arterial oxygen values by means of an empirically derived calibration curve. Results Significantly lower R/IR values were found at the forehead compared with the fontanelle, the parietal and occipital position, and the temporal area. Conversion to oxygen saturation values revealed a difference of up to 13.4{\%} in oxygen saturation between the forehead and the occipital area. Conclusion Assuming that the arterial blood oxygen saturation did not change substantially, our findings indicate that in reflectance pulse oximetry there is no unique relation between R/IR and arterial oxygen saturation. The differences in reflectance pulse oximetry at the various sites are explained by differences in optical properties (scattering and absorption) of the tissue underneath the sensor. These will affect the red and infrared light reaching the detectors in a different way, and consequently R/IR changes. Because during intrapartum monitoring exact positioning of the sensor on the fetal head is usually impossible, the accuracy of fetal reflectance pulse oximetry is impaired. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley.

abstract = {Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), a major prognostic indicator of cardiovascular events, may be augmented in hypertension as a result of the aorta being stretched by a higher distending blood pressure or by a structural change. We used a novel technique to modulate intrathoracic pressure and thus aortic transmural pressure (TMP) to examine the variation of intrathoracic aPWV with TMP in hypertensive (n=20; mean±SD age, 52.1±15.3 years; blood pressure, 159.6±21.2/92.0±15.9 mm Hg) and normotensive (n=20; age, 55.5±11.1 years; blood pressure, 124.5±11.9/72.6±9.1 mm Hg) subjects. aPWV was measured using dual Doppler probes to insonate the right brachiocephalic artery and aorta at the level of the diaphragm. Resting aPWV was greater in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects (897±50 cm/s versus 784±43 cm/s; P{\textless}0.05). aPWV was equal in hypertensive and normotensive subjects when measured at a TMP of 96 mm Hg. However, dependence of aPWV on TMP in normotensive subjects was greater than that in hypertensive subjects (9.6±1.6 versus 3.8±0.7 cm/s per mm Hg increase in TMP, respectively, means±SEM; P{\textless}0.01). This experimental behavior was best explained by a theoretical model incorporating strain-induced recruitment of stiffer fibers in normotensive subjects and fully recruited stiffer fibers in hypertensive subjects. These results explain previous contradictory findings with respect to isobaric aPWV in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects. They suggest that hypertension is associated with a profound change in aortic wall mechanical properties possibly because of destruction of elastin leading to less strain-induced stiffening and predisposition to aortic dissection.},

This paper presents mobile cloud computing for a healthcare system where a noncontact ECG measurement method is employed to capture biomedical signals from users. Healthcare service is provided to continuously collect biomedical signals from multiple locations. To observe and analyze the ECG signals in real time, a mobile device is used as a mobile monitoring terminal. In addition, a personalized healthcare assistant is installed on the mobile device; several healthcare features such as health status summaries, medication QR code scanning, and reminders are integrated into the mobile application. Health data are being synchronized into the healthcare cloud computing service (Web server system and Web server dataset) to ensure a seamless healthcare monitoring system and anytime and anywhere coverage of network connection is available. Together with a Web page application, medical data are easily accessed by medical professionals or family members. Web page performance evaluation was conducted to ensure minimal Web server latency. The system demonstrates better availability of off-site and up-to-the-minute patient data, which can help detect health problems early and keep elderly patients out of the emergency room, thus providing a better and more comprehensive healthcare cloud computing service. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this capacitive coupling measurement a metal plate is placed outside the body and this plate and the electric signal source inside body forms a condenser and the electric biosignal can be derived through this condenser. Here we studied ECG measurement using two or only one capacitive coupling electrodes without any ground electrode for more convenient ECG monitoring. Three ECG measurement methods different in the setting of capacitive coupling electrodes and ground electrode were tested as follows; two isolated signal electrodes with an isolated ground electrode, two isolated signal electrodes without any ground electrode and one isolated signal electrode without any ground electrode. As a result, two Isolated electrodes are enough to measure ECG whether with a ground electrode or not. Moreover ECG can be measured with only one signal electrode. Of course ECG waveform was noisy but "R" peak of ECG could be detected. Same tendencies were confirmed in all five subjects participated in experiments. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Continuous beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure (BP) monitoring with a simultaneous arterial waveform display is typically achieved with an invasive arterial catheter. We evaluated a noninvasive device, the T-Line{\textregistered} Tensymeter, that provides a calibrated arterial pressure waveform from which continuous BP measurements and heart rate may be computed by either a bedside host monitor or the tensymeter device itself. In 25 patients given general anesthesia, we measured systolic, mean, and diastolic BPs via the tensymeter and compared these measurements with those obtained from the contralateral radial artery catheter. Data were analyzed using the Bland Altman test to determine agreement between the two systems. The mean ± SD bias and precision (mm Hg) were as follows: 1.7 ± 7.0 and 5.7 ± 4.4 for systolic BP; 2.3 ± 6.9 and 5.7 ± 4.5 for diastolic BP; and 1.7 ± 5.3 and 4.0 ± 4.8 for mean BP. Noninvasive pressures from the tensymeter-produced arterial waveform agreed with simultaneous contralateral BPs measured from arterial catheters within an acceptable clinical range for a limited population of surgical patients studied over a systolic arterial BP range from 41 to 189 mm Hg without significant temporal performance degradation. The tensymeter may enable physicians to circumvent arterial cannulation in certain circumstances (such as with low- or intermediate-risk procedures) on patients when beat-to-beat BP measurement is desirable. {\textcopyright}2006 by the International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate three methods aimed at the reconstruction of brachial pressure from non-invasive finger arterial pressure measurements as implemented in the Finometer™, (FMS, Finapres Measurement Systems, Arnhem, Netherlands), the successor to the Finapres™ (TNO Siomedical Instrumentation, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Methods: Finger arterial pressure (FinAP) may differ from intra-brachial pressure (BAP). Pulse shape differences are removed by applying a generalized waveform filter. Pressure level differences are corrected by a generalized level correction equation using filtered systolic and diastolic levels and by level calibration, which uses an additional return-to-flow (RTF) systolic pressure measurement on the ipsilateral upper arm for an individual calibration of the reconstructed brachial pressure. Validation: These methods were validated in 37 subjects, aged 41 to 83 years after a cardiac catheterization procedure. Intra-brachial and Finometer pressures were recorded simultaneously. Finometer pressures were compared after application of waveform filtering and level correction (flcAP), and after an additional RTF calibration (reBAP). Results: Finger arterial systolic, diastolic and mean pressures for the group differed from SAP by -9.7 ± 13.0, -11.6 ± 8.0 and -16.3 ± 7.9 mmHg (mean ± SD) respectively. Similarly flcAP differed by -1.1 ± 10.7, -0.2 ± 6.8 and -1.5 ± 6.6 mmHg and reBAP differed by 3.1 ± 7.6, 4.0 ± 5.6 and 2.7 ± 4.7 mmHg. Conclusion: Reconstruction of BAP from FinAP as implemented in the Finometer reduces the pressure differences, with an individual RTF calibration to well within AAMI requirements. {\textcopyright} 2003 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {When blood pressure is measured in the finger using the volume clamp method the value at which the vascular volume is clamped is of crucial importance. Since the discovery of the method, several criteria of finding a correct set point have been elaborated: 1. The volume oscillations reach their maximum amplitude at cuff pressure equalling mean blood pressure. 2. The form of the diastolic portion of volume pulsations changes if the cuff pressure moves around the mean blood pressure. 3. The set point can be positioned at one third of the arterial volume. 4. The dynamic vascular compliance (DVC) may be continuously measured as the instantaneous amplitude of vascular volume oscillations is elicited by a relatively small and rapid vibration of the cuff pressure. The shape of the DVC pulse characteristically depends on the transmural pressure (TP): at negative TP (cuff pressure exceeding the blood pressure) it shows a distinct positive systolic peak, at positive TP the polarity of the DVC pulse is reversed. In contrast to the first three ways to find the set point, the last one may operate even in closed-loop performance, i.e. during the blood pressure measurement.},

Design: Prospective data collection. Setting: Emergency department in a 2,000-bed inner city hospital. Patients: Thirty-eight patients categorized into three groups according to their upper-arm circumference (group I: 18-25 cm; group II:25.1-33 cm; and group III: 33.1-47.5 cm) were enrolled in the study protocol. Interventions: In each patient, all three cuff sizes (Hewlett-Packard Cuff 40401 B, C, and D) were used to perform an oscillometric blood pressure measurement at least within 3 mins until ten to 20 measurements for each cuff size were achieved. Invasive mean arterial blood pressure measurement was done by cannulation of the contralateral radial artery with direct transduction of the systemic arterial pressure waveform. The corresponding invasive blood pressure value was obtained at the end of each oscillometric measurement. Measurement and Main Results: Overall, 1,494 pairs of simultaneous oscillometric and invasive blood pressure measurements were collected in 38 patients (group I, n = 5; group II, n = 23; and group III, n = 10) over a total time of 72.3 hrs. Mean arterial blood pressure ranged from 35 to 165 mm Hg. The overall discrepancy between oscillometric and invasive blood pressure measurement was -6.7 ± 9.7 mm Hg (p {\textless} .0001), if the recommended cuff size according to the upper-arm circumference was used (539 measurements). Of all the blood pressure measurements, 26.4{\%} (n = 395) had a discrepancy of ≥10 mm Hg and 34.2{\%} (n = 512) exhibited a discrepancy of ≥20 mm Hg. No differences between invasive and noninvasive blood pressure measurements were noted in patients either with or without inotropic support (-6.6 + 7.2 vs. -8.6 + 6.8 mm Hg; not significant). Conclusion: The oscillometric blood pressure measurement significantly underestimates arterial blood pressure and exhibits a high number of measurements out of the clinically acceptable range. The relation between cuff size and upper-arm circumference contributes substantially to the inaccuracy of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement. Therefore, oscillometric blood pressure measurement does not achieve adequate accuracy in critically ill patients.},

abstract = {Objective: Although a large variety of automated blood pressure devices are available, only some have been validated for use in clinical practice. The British Hypertension Society (BHS) recommends separate validation of automated devices in special subgroups, e.g. the elderly and pregnant women. The aim of this study was to compare the Finometer™ (FM) and the earlier validated SpaceLabs 90207™ (SL) with standard auscultatory blood pressure measurements in normal, pre-eclamptic and hypertensive pregnancy, following the guidelines of the BHS and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Methods: The total study group consisted of 123 pregnant women, of whom were 54 normotensive, 31 pre-eclamptic and 38 hypertensive. Automated readings with the FM and SL were compared with auscultatory blood pressure measurements. Bland - Altman plots, BHS grades, mean pressure differences and 95{\%} limits of agreement were used for analysis. Results: Bland - Altman plots showed a wide scatter of the pressure differences between auscultatory and automated measurements. FM achieved BHS grades C/D, C/B, D/D and D/D in the total, normotensive, pre-eclamptic and hypertensive group, respectively. The AAMI criteria were only met for diastolic blood pressure in the normotensive group. For SL almost Identical BHS grades and 95{\%} limits of agreement as compared to our earlier study were found. Conclusions: The accuracy and precision of the Finometer™ are not sufficient for determination of absolute blood pressure levels in individual pregnant women. Our present findings on the SpaceLabs 90207™ reconfirm our earlier results. {\textcopyright} 2003 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Background: Hemodynamic monitoring plays a pivotal role in the treatment of patients in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The innovative radial artery applanation tonometry technology allows for continuous noninvasive arterial blood pressure (AP) measurement. By closing the gap between continuous invasive AP monitoring (arterial catheter) and intermittent noninvasive AP monitoring (oscillometry) this technology might improve CICU patient monitoring. We therefore aimed to evaluate the measurement performance of radial artery applanation tonometry in comparison with a radial arterial catheter in CICU patients. Methods: In this prospective method comparison study, we simultaneously recorded AP noninvasively with radial artery applanation tonometry (T-line 200pro device; Tensys Medical Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and invasively with an arterial catheter (criterion standard) in 30 patients treated in the CICU of a German university hospital. We statistically analyzed 7,304 averaged 10-beat epochs of measurements of mean AP, systolic AP, and diastolic AP by using Bland–Altman analysis for repeated measurements. Results: Our study revealed a mean difference ± standard deviation (95 {\%} limits of agreement; percentage error) between radial artery applanation tonometry and the criterion standard method (radial arterial catheter) of +2 ± 6 mmHg (−10 to +14 mmHg; 17 {\%}) for mean AP, −6 ± 11 mmHg (−28 to +15 mmHg; 20 {\%}) for systolic AP, and +4 ± 7 mmHg (−9 to +17 mmHg; 23 {\%}) for diastolic AP. Conclusions: In CICU patients, continuous noninvasive measurement of AP using radial artery applanation tonometry is feasible. The technology showed reasonable accuracy and precision in comparison with radial arterial catheter-derived AP values.},

abstract = {Since both, hypotension and hypertension, can potentially impair the function of vital organs such as heart, brain, or kidneys, monitoring of arterial blood pressure (BP) is a mainstay of hemodynamic monitoring in acutely or critically ill patients. Arterial BP can either be obtained invasively via an arterial catheter or non-invasively. Non-invasive BP measurement provides either intermittent or continuous readings. Most commonly, an occluding upper arm cuff is used for intermittent non-invasive monitoring. BP values are then obtained either manually (by auscultation of Korotkoff sounds or palpation) or automatically (e.g., by oscillometry). For continuous non-invasive BP monitoring, the volume clamp method or arterial applanation tonometry can be used. Both techniques enable the arterial waveform and BP values to be obtained continuously. This article describes the different techniques for non-invasive BP measurement, their advantages and limitations, and their clinical applicability.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) normally decreases during the night. Absence of this phenomenon (nondipping) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Altered autonomic and endocrine circadian rhythms are suspected to play a role. Patients with peripheral autonomic failure offer a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon, because approximately 50{\%} develop supine hypertension despite very low autonomic function. The purpose of this study was to define the prevalence of dipping in these patients and to determine whether dipping is associated with less severe autonomic impairment or exaggerated nocturnal sodium excretion. We collected BP and urine from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am in 41 peripheral autonomic failure patients with supine hypertension. Dipping (systolic BP fall {\textgreater}or=10{\%} during 12 am to 6 am from baseline [8 pm to 10 pm]) occurred in 34{\%} of patients, with an average decrease of -44+/-4 mm Hg at 4 am. Systolic BP, averaged from 12 am to 6 am, decreased to normotensive levels in 50{\%} (n=7) of dippers and 15{\%} (n=7) of nondippers. There were no significant differences in the severity of autonomic failure, nocturnal diuresis, or natriuresis (0.18+/-0.01 in dippers versus 0.18+/-0.01 mEq/mg of creatinine in nondippers; P=0.522) between groups. At 8:00 am, orthostatic hypotension was similar between groups (-84/-35+/-9/4 mm Hg in dippers versus -93/-39+/-6/3 mm Hg in nondippers; P=0.356 for systolic BP). In conclusion, dipping was observed in one third of patients with peripheral autonomic failure, so that a significant percentage of patients would not require treatment for supine hypertension. Dipping was not associated with increased nocturnal urinary sodium or volume excretion or less severe autonomic failure. Thus, mechanisms independent of autonomic pathways contribute to BP dipping in these patients.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of possible error in the measurement of systolic blood pressure if disposable, built-in diaphragm, transducer domes or long extension tubes between the patient and pressure transducer are used. Sinusoidal or arterial pressure patterns were generated with specially designed equipment. With a long extension tube or trapped air bubbles, the resonant frequency of the catheter system was reduced so that the arterial pulse was amplified as it acted on the transducer and, thus, gave an erroneously high systolic pressure measurement. The authors found this error to be as much as 20 mm Hg. Trapped air bubbles, not stopcocks or connections, per se, lead to poor fidelity. The utility of a continuous catheter flush system (Sorenson, Intraflow) to estimate the resonant frequency and degree of damping of a catheter-transducer system is described, as are possibly erroneous conclusions. Given a rough estimate of the resonant frequency of a catheter-transducer system and the magnitude of overshoot in response to a pulse, the authors present a table to predict the magnitude of probable error. These studies confirm the variability and unreliability of static calibration that may occur using some safety diaphragm domes and show that the system frequency response is decreased if air bubbles are trapped between the diaphragms. The authors conclude that regular procedures should be established to evaluate the accuracy of the pressure measuring systems in use, the transducer should be placed as close to the patient as possible, the air bubbles should be assiduously eliminated from the system.},

A wide range of CMR sequences have been developed to assess various aspects of cardiac structure and function, and significant advances have also been made in terms of imaging quality and acquisition times. A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges. Furthermore, we review the most recent state-of-the art techniques for the automatic segmentation of the cardiac boundaries, which are necessary for the calculation of the CMR indices. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the existing literature and of the future challenges that need to be addressed to enable a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the cardiac chambers in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Objective Pulse transit time (PTT) refers to the time it takes a pulse wave to travel between two arterial sites. PTT can be estimated, amongst others, using the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). Because we observed a sawtooth artifact in the PTT while using standard patient monitoring equipment for ECG and PPG, we explored the reasons for this artifact. Methods PPG and ECG were simulated at a heartrate of both 100 and 160 beats per minute while using a Masimo PPG post-processing module and a Philips patient monitor setup at the neonatal intensive care unit. Two different post-processing modules were used. PTT was defined as the difference between the R-peak in the ECG and the point of 50{\%} increase in the PPG. Results A sawtooth artifact was seen in all simulations. Both length (59.2 to 72.4 s) and amplitude (30.8 to 36.0 ms) of the sawtooth were dependent on the post-processing module used. Furthermore, the absolute PTT value differed up to 250 ms depending on post-processing module and heart rate. The sawtooth occurred because the PPG wave continuously showed a minimal prolongation during the length of the sawtooth, followed by a sudden shortening. Both artifacts were generated in the post-processing module containing Masimo algorithms. Conclusion Post-processing of the PPG signal in the Masimo module of the Philips patient monitor introduces a sawtooth in PPG and derived PTT. This sawtooth, together with a large module-dependent absolute difference in PTT, renders the thus-derived PTT insufficient for clinical purposes.},

We address the robustness issues of PTT extraction, since the pulsatile signals are subject to distortions due to sensor errors or subject movements. A cepstrum analysis method is proposed to estimate the pulse rate from each modality, and then a signal quality assessment is conducted by verifying the conformance of the pulse rate with the pulse time for a single modality as well as across multiple modalities. Erroneous peaks in the distorted pulsatile signal can be rejected by the quality screening step. Experiments were conducted using PhysioNet database MIMIC-II comprising ECG, PPG and Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signals, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and furthermore provided insights to the MIMIC-II database.},

abstract = {Background: Within the intensive care unit (ICU), arterial blood pressure (ABP) is typically recorded at different (and sometimes uneven) sampling frequencies, and from different sensors, and is often corrupted by different artifacts and noise which are often non-Gaussian, nonlinear and nonstationary. Extracting robust parameters from such signals, and providing confidences in the estimates is therefore difficult and requires an adaptive filtering approach which accounts for artifact types. Methods: Using a large ICU database, and over 6000 hours of simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) and ABP waveforms sampled at 125 Hz from a 437 patient subset, we documented six general types of ABP artifact. We describe a new ABP signal quality index (SQI), based upon the combination of two previously reported signal quality measures weighted together. One index measures morphological normality, and the other degradation due to noise. After extracting a 6084-hour subset of clean data using our SQI, we evaluated a new robust tracking algorithm for estimating blood pressure and heart rate (HR) based upon a Kalman Filter (KF) with an update sequence modified by the KF innovation sequence and the value of the SQI. In order to do this, we have created six novel models of different categories of artifacts that we have identified in our ABP waveform data. These artifact models were then injected into clean ABP waveforms in a controlled manner. Clinical blood pressure (systolic, mean and diastolic) estimates were then made from the ABP waveforms for both clean and corrupted data. The mean absolute error for systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was then calculated for different levels of artifact pollution to provide estimates of expected errors given a single value of the SQI. Results: Our artifact models demonstrate that artifact types have differing effects on systolic, diastolic and mean ABP estimates. We show that, for most artifact types, diastolic ABP estimates are less noise-sensitive than mean ABP estimates, which in turn are more robust than systolic ABP estimates. We also show that our SQI can provide error bounds for both HR and ABP estimates. Conclusion: The KF/SQI-fusion method described in this article was shown to provide an accurate estimate of blood pressure and HR derived from the ABP waveform even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during extreme bradycardia and tachycardia. Differences in error between artifact types, measurement sensors and the quality of the source signal can be factored into physiological estimation using an unbiased adaptive filter, signal innovation and signal quality measures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The ABP waveform may be used for cardiac output (CO) estimation, suppression of ECG-based false alarms, and tracking long term trends such as mean pressure. An abnormal ABP waveform may cause these applications to give undesirable results. In this paper, we present a signal abnormality index (SAI) algorithm that detects abnormal beats in ABP waveforms. The algorithm flags ABP beats by intelligently setting constraints on physiologic, noise/artifact, and beat-to-beat variation values. Compared to an expert annotator, the algorithm's sensitivity=1, specificity=0.91, positive predictive value=0.73, and negative predictive value=1. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to show SAI's robustness. Finally, we use SAI to identify clean ABP segments from our study population and show that CO estimation error is 30{\%} less in the clean subset than in the entire population.},

abstract = {Study objectives: The current criterion standard for measuring inspiratory effort, esophageal manometry, is an invasive procedure that young patients find intolerable. Inspiratory effort can also be assessed noninvasively by measuring the pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is the time the pulse wave (PW) takes to travel between two arterial sites (normally heart to finger). The speed at which the PW travels is directly proportional to arterial BP. When BP rises, PTT shortens. Conversely, when BP falls, PTT lengthens. In this study, we investigated PTT as a measure for evaluating inspiratory effort in children. Participants: We studied 15 healthy children (age range, 5 to 12 years; mean age [± SD], 8.3 ± 2.74; 9 male children) selected from patients referred to our pediatric center for routine assessment. Measurements and results: We assessed changes in the PTT during breathing against known resistances in awake children. Resistance was applied to the nose and mouth with a modified, two-way, nonrebreathing facemask. Our data show a good correlation between the induced inspiratory effort and the amplitude of PTT variations. Conclusions: PTT should be a useful method for quantifying changes in inspiratory effort due to augmented upper airway resistance in awake children.},

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of fentanyl, remifentanil or fentanyl plus morphine on the incidence of PONV and pain in women subjected to cesarean section under general anesthesia. Methods: The study was a randomized clinical trial recruiting 96 parturients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II. They scheduled for cesarean section under general anesthesia using sodium thiopental, succynylcholine, and isoflurane O2/N2O 50/50 mixture. After clamping the umbilical cord, the patients were given fentanyl (2 $\mu$g/kg/h), remifentanil (0.05 $\mu$g/kg/h), or fentanyl (2 $\mu$g/kg) pulse morphine (0.1 mg/kg) intravenously. Visual analog scale for pain and nausea, frequency of PONV, meperidine and metoclopramide consumption were evaluated at recovery, and 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the surgery. Results: There was no significant difference between the three groups in terms of frequency of nausea, vomiting, and mean nausea and pain scores at any time points. None of the patients required the administration of metoclopramide. However, the mean VAS for pain in remifentanil-treated group was insignificantly more than that in fentanyl- or fentanyl plus morphine- treated group at recovery or 4 hours after the surgery. The mean mepridine consumption in remifentanil-treated group was significantly (P=0.001) more than that in fentanylor fentanyl plus morphine-treated group in 24 hours after the surgery respectively. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters of the three groups in all measurements after the surgery. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that early postoperative analgesia was better with fentanyl, and postoperative meperidine consumption was significantly less with fentanyl than with remifentanil or combined fentayl and morphine.},

The method provides a dynamical characterization of the important autonomic and mechanical mechanisms responsible for coupling the fluctuations (inverse modeling). To carry out the evaluation, we developed a computational model of the cardiovascular system capable of generating realistic beat-to-beat variability (forward modeling). We applied the method to data generated from the forward model and compared the resulting estimated dynamics with the actual dynamics of the forward model, which were either precisely known or easily determined. We found that the estimated dynamics corresponded to the actual dynamics and that this correspondence was robust to forward model uncertainty. We also demonstrated the sensitivity of the method in detecting small changes in parameters characterizing autonomic function in the forward model.

So, unlike the conventional foot-to-foot detection technique, this technique should be robust to artifact while revealing the true PTT (i.e., the PTT in absence of wave reflection). We compared the two techniques, as applied to blood pressure and flow waveforms, in terms of the ability of their PTT estimates to correlate with blood pressure (a) during baseline (for which the naturally occurring beat-to-beat changes were small), (b) during low heart rate (wherein wave reflection was profound), and (c) in the presence of actual measurement artifact.

abstract = {Introduction. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) plays an important role in assessing cardiovascular prognosis, through presence or absence of ABPM-related prognostic features. Objectives. To study relationship between 24-hour ABPM and cardiovascular outcomes in patients from Chesterfield Royal Hospital. Material and Methods. Over 12 months from the 1st of August 2002, 1187 individuals had 24-hour ABPM performed. Cardiovascular outcomes were studied in a subset (297) of the original cohort, made up by every 4th consecutive subject. The following ABPM-related prognostic features were studied-high day time systolic and diastolic BP ({\textless}135, {\textless}85 mmHg), high night time systolic and diastolic BP ({\textless}120 mmHg, {\textless}75 mmHg), absence of nocturnal dip (≤10{\%} fall in night time SBP), high early morning SBP ({\textless}140 mmHg), and morning surge ({\textless}20/15 mmHg). The cardiovascular outcomes studied in the fourth table included fatal and nonfatal MI, new diagnosis of angina, acute coronary syndrome, sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrhythmias, acute LVF, cerbrovascular events, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and CKD stage 3 or above. Results. Over a followup period of 2015 ± 116 days (1720-2305 days) 82 cardiovascular events occurred in 61 subjects. Cardiac arrhythmias were the most common CV outcome (34 events) followed by cerebrovascular events (15). Statistically significant associations found were between cerebrovascular events and absent nocturnal dip ≤ 10{\%} (P =.05) and high day time DBP (P =.029), peripheral vascular disease and morning surge {\textless} 20/15 mmHg (P =.014), cardiac arrhythmias and high day time and night time DBP (P =.009 and.033, resp.). Conclusion. Significant associations were found between cerebrovascular events and absent nocturnal dip ≤ 10{\%} and high day time DBP, peripheral vascular disease and morning surge {\textless} 20/15 mmHg, cardiac arrhythmias and high day time and night time DBP.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to determine a set of timing, shape, and statistical features available through noninvasive monitoring of maternal electrocardiogram and photoplethysmography that identifies preeclamptic patients. METHODS: Pregnant women admitted to Labor and Delivery were monitored with pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram for 30 minutes. Photoplethysmogram features and heart rate variability were extracted from each data set and applied to a sequential feature selection algorithm to discriminate women with preeclampsia with severe features, from normotensive and hypertensive controls. The classification boundary was chosen to minimize the expected misclassification cost. The prior probabilities of the misclassification costs were assumed to be equal. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with clinically diagnosed preeclampsia with severe features were compared with 43 normotensive controls; all were in early labor or beginning induction. Six variables were used in the final model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.907 (standard error [SE] = 0.004) (sensitivity 78.2{\%} [SE = 0.3{\%}], specificity 89.9{\%} [SE = 0.1{\%}]) with a positive predictive value of 0.883 (SE = 0.001). Twenty-eight subjects with chronic or gestational hypertension were compared with the same preeclampsia group, generating a model with 5 features with an area under the curve of 0.795 (SE = 0.007; sensitivity 79.0{\%} [SE = 0.2{\%}], specificity 68.7{\%} [SE = 0.4{\%}]), and a positive predictive value of 0.799 (SE = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular parameters, as assessed noninvasively by photoplethysmography and heart rate variability, may have a role in screening women suspected of having preeclampsia, particularly in areas with limited resources.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a well-known method for the assessment of autonomic nervous function of the heart. Previous study suggested that pulse rate variability (PRV) determined by photoplethysmography could be used instead of HRV to more simply assess autonomic nervous function. However, most research studies included healthy subjects. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility for PRV as a surrogate index for patients with chronic pain. This study investigated the correlation coefficient (by Pearson correlation) and agreement (by Bland–Altman analysis) between PRV and HRV in chronic pain patients in the clinical setting. The results showed high significant correlations (p {\textless} 0.001, r {\textgreater} 0.86) between all the HRV and PRV parameters and good agreements (ratio {\textless} 0.1) between the parameters in terms of HR, mean RR, VLF, LF, nLF, nHF, and SD1/SD2. Our study suggests that HRV can also be reliably estimated using the photoplethysmography-based PP interval in elderly patients with chronic pain.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), extracted from an electrocardiogram, is known to be a noninvasive indicator reflecting the dynamic interplay between perturbations to cardiovascular function and the dynamic response of the cardiovascular regulatory system. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive method to monitor arterial oxygen saturation on a continuous basis. Given the rich cardiovascular information in the PPG signal, and the ubiquity and simplicity of pulse oximetry, we are investigating the feasibility of acquiring dynamics pertaining to the autonomic nervous system from PPG waveforms. To do this, we are quantifying PPG variability (PPGV). Detailed algorithmic approaches for extracting accurate PPGV signals are presented. We compare PPGV to HRV by computing time and frequency domain parameters often associated with HRV measurements, as well as approximate entropy calculations. Our results demonstrate that the parameters of PPGV are highly correlated with the parameters of HRV. Thus, our results indicate that PPGV could be used as an alternative measurement of HRV. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

Both parameters showed oscillations at a relatively low frequency, about 0.02 Hz, and a relatively high frequency, about 0.3 Hz, which is related to respiration. These frequencies are similar to those found in measurements of heart rate variability — which is also obtained by measuring the photoplethysmographic period variability — but the powers of the different frequencies are different. The low frequency oscillation, which is attributed to the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, is more pronounced in the measurements of tissue blood volume and of systolic blood volume increase than in the measurement of heart rate. {\textcopyright} 1994 Walter de Gruyter.

abstract = {Background: Cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) are two important parameters of the cardiovascular system. The ability to measure these parameters continuously and noninvasively may assist in diagnosing and monitoring patients with suspected cardiovascular diseases, or other critical illnesses. In this study, a method is proposed to estimate both the CO and SVR of a heterogeneous cohort of intensive care unit patients (N=48).Methods: Spectral and morphological features were extracted from the finger photoplethysmogram, and added to heart rate and mean arterial pressure as input features to a multivariate regression model to estimate CO and SVR. A stepwise feature search algorithm was employed to select statistically significant features. Leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the generalized model performance. The degree of agreement between the estimation method and the gold standard was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis.Results: The Bland-Altman bias ±precision (1.96 times standard deviation) for CO was -0.01 ±2.70 L min-1 when only photoplethysmogram (PPG) features were used, and for SVR was -0.87 ±412 dyn.s.cm-5 when only one PPG variability feature was used.Conclusions: These promising results indicate the feasibility of using the method described as a non-invasive preliminary diagnostic tool in supervised or unsupervised clinical settings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lee et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The baseline and the amplitude of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal also show fluctuations in the same frequencies. In the current study, PPG examinations were performed on the fingers of normal subjects and diabetic patients, and three parameters were derived from each PPG pulse: the baseline of the pulse, its amplitude and its period (which is equal to the heart period). The level of the variability of each PPG pulse parameter was measured by the ratio of the standard deviation of the parameter to its mean value. The level of the low-frequency fluctuations for the PPG amplitude and for the heart cycle period did not differ between males and females, but was lower for diabetic patients, indicating lower activity of the autonomic nervous system. The curves of the baseline and the amplitude of the PPG signal for the non-diabetic subjects showed high correlation between the left and the right hands. For most of the diabetic patients the right-left correlation coefficients were significantly lower than those for the non-diabetic subjects.

abstract = {Background: Analgesia is a part of balanced anaesthesia, but direct indicators of nociception do not exist. We examined the relationship between motor reactions and physiological variables during skin incision in sevoflurane anaesthesia and hypothesized that nociception could be detected and graded by significant changes in these variables. Methods: Thirty-one women scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy participated in the study. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (1 $\mu$g kg-1), propofol (1 mg kg-1) and sevoflurane. Skin incision was performed 14 min after induction during 1.6{\%} endtidal sevoflurane anaesthesia without neuromuscular blockade. Electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG) and electroencephalography (EEG) were registered, and a range of variables was computed from these signals. The postincision values, normalized with respect to their preincision values, of movers vs. non-movers were compared. The variables showing significant differences between movers and non-movers were used to develop a logistic regression equation for the classification of patients into movers or non-movers. Results: Twenty-six patients were eligible for analysis, and 12 (46{\%}) displayed a motor reaction to skin incision (movers). Many ECG, PPG and EEG-related variables showed significant differences between the pre- and postincision periods. The best classification performance, assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation, between movers and non-movers was achieved with the combination of response entropy of EEG, RR-interval and PPG notch amplitude. The corresponding equation yielded 96{\%} correct classification with 90{\%} sensitivity and 100{\%} specificity. The classification performance of any single variable alone was considerably worse. Conclusion: Combination of information from different sources may be required for monitoring the adequacy of analgesia during anaesthesia. Copyright {\textcopyright} Acta Anaesthesiol Scand 2005.},

PPG signal's second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

abstract = {The ratio of two wave components [b/a] constituting the second derivative of the plethysmogram (SDPTG) was correlated with arterial distensibility. Eighty-two subjects (33-93 years old) were classified into three groups according to the thickness of the intima-media complex of the common carotid artery measured by B-mode ultrasonography. One group was non-atherosclerotic (without pathologic thickening) (nAS) and the other two groups atherosclerotic (mild and severe thickening, or plaque formation) (AS-1 and AS-2). Distensibility (D) of the common carotid artery was calculated from arterial dimensions and blood pressure: h/p = D, where h = (Ds-Dd)/Dd; Ds, Dd and p represent the inner diameter of the carotid artery at peak systole, at end diastole and brachial pulse pressure, respectively. The plethysmogram was recorded at the cuticle of the 2nd digit of the left hand, and the SDPTG was determined with a 10 msec time constant. D showed a significant negative correlation with age in all subjects and in the three separate groups. The correlation between age and [b/a] was significantly negative in all subjects. This negative correlation was not observed in the nAS group, while it was significant in both AS-1 and AS-2. The correlation between [b/a] and D was significantly positive in all subjects and in each group. Significant differences were found among the three groups for [b/a] and D. These results suggest that a decrease in [b/a] or in D was proportional to the thickness of the intima-media complex of the carotid artery, that is, the development of atherosclerosis. These results provide direct evidence that [b/a] of the SDPTG is related to the distensibility of the peripheral artery, and suggest that [b/a] is a useful non-invasive index of atherosclerosis and altered arterial distensibility.},

However, PTT is just a time index derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), while BP-related information within the PPG waveform has seldom been taken into consideration. We hypothesized that PPG waveform feature might be useful for BP estimation. Nine healthy subjects took part in an exercise stress test, including baseline resting, exercise on bicycle ergometry and recovering resting. ECG of lead V5 and PPG from left finger were collected simultaneously, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded from a cuff sphygmometer on the right wrist. The correlation coefficients were obtained between BP (SBP, DBP and pulse pressure (PP)) and PPG morphological indices (total 15 indices in terms of waveform amplitude, time span and area ratio). Five PPG indices were correlated with both SBP and PP (absolute value of correlation coefficient |r| {\textgreater} 0.6) and were further tested for the capability to BP estimation, which were: (1) PTT A, time delay between the R peak of ECG and the foot point of PPG; (2) RSD, time ratio of systole to diastole; (3) RtArea, area ratio of systole to diastole; (4) TmBB, time span of PPG cycle; (5) TmCA, diastolic duration. Comparisons were made between the measured BP and the estimated BP by regression lines and quadratic curve fitting, respectively. As a result, the mean errors of SBP liner fitting with RSD, RtArea, TmBB and TmCA respectively were 5.5, 5.4, 5.2, 5.1 mmHg, which were smaller than that with PTTA of 5.8 mmHg. And the mean errors of SBP quadratic curve fitting with RSD, RtArea, TmBB and TmCA were all 5.1 mmHg, which were smaller than that with PTTA of 5.7 mmHg. The mean errors of multiple regression for SBP, PP and DBP was 4.7, 4.7, 3.5 mmHg respectively, which were more accurate than the regression with single PTTA of 5.8, 5.3, 5.2 mmHg respectively. However, PPG-based SBP and DBP could under estimate cuff pressure by 8 mmHg and over estimate by 10 mmHg respectively, which is a clinically significant error. In conclusion, the combination of time span (PTT, time ratio of systole to diastole, time span of PPG cycle and diastolic duration) and waveform morphology (area ratio of systole to diastole) could improve the performance of PPG-based BP estimation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.},

abstract = {Peripheral vascular disease is a frequently occurring disease and is most often caused by atherosclerosis and more rarely by anomalies of the collagen or other components of the arterial wall. Arterial stiffness problems form one of the precursor phenomena of peripheral vascular disease, and in the case of atherosclerosis represents an independent risk marker for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The first techniques, developed to evaluate arterial stiffness, use indirect measurements such as pulse wave velocity or the analysis of variations in pressure and volume to estimate arterial wall stiffness. Techniques based on the pulse wave lack precision because they assume that arterial stiffness is uniform throughout the path of the pulse wave, and that it is constant throughout the cardiac cycle. Moreover, measuring the velocity of the pulse wave may be less precise in certain pathological situations: metabolic syndrome, obesity, large chest, mega-dolico artery. Techniques based on the analysis of variations in pressure and in volume do not accurately measure blood pressure, which can only be taken externally. In addition, these techniques require dedicated equipment, which is not reimbursed by the French health care system, and which is cumbersome to use (especially for techniques based on variation in pressure) in clinical practice. This explains why these two techniques are not used in clinical practice. Ultrafast echography is a new ultrasound imaging method that can record up to 10,000 images per second. This high temporal resolution makes it possible tomeasure the velocity of the local pulse wave and arterial wall stiffness thanks to the remote palpation carried out by shear wave. The ease of use and the accuracy of these two techniques suggest that these diagnostic applications will play a significant role in vascular pathology in the future. It is possible in real time, using a traditional vascular ultrasound probe, to make an accurate assessment of local arterial stiffness and of its variation during the cardiac cycle. This technological breakthrough will probably improve phenotype evaluation of patients suffering from vascular diseases, to more effectively evaluate the cardiovascular risk for patients, at primary and secondary prevention level, and to carry out broad epidemiological studies on cardiovascular risks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of the {\'{E}}ditions fran{\c{c}}aises de radiologie.},

abstract = {Analysis of pulse waveform is a low cost, non-invasive method for obtaining vital information related to the conditions of the cardiovascular system. In recent years, different Pulse Decomposition Analysis (PDA) methods have been applied to disclose the pathological mechanisms of the pulse waveform. All these methods decompose single-period pulse waveform into a constant number (such as 3, 4 or 5) of individual waves. Furthermore, those methods do not pay much attention to the estimation error of the key points in the pulse waveform. The estimation of human vascular conditions depends on the key points' positions of pulse wave. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Gaussian (MG) model to fit real pulse waveforms using an adaptive number (4 or 5 in our study) of Gaussian waves. The unknown parameters in the MG model are estimated by the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method and the optimized weight values corresponding to different sampling points are selected by using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. Performance of the MG model and the WLS method has been evaluated by fitting 150 real pulse waveforms of five different types. The resulting Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) was less than 2.0{\%} and the estimation accuracy for the key points was satisfactory, demonstrating that our proposed method is effective in compressing, synthesizing and analyzing pulse waveforms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cardiac output (CO) monitoring is essential for indicating the perfusion status of the human cardiovascular system under different physiological conditions. However, it is currently limited to hospital use due to the need for either skilled operators or big, expensive measurement devices. Therefore, in this paper we devise a new CO indicator which can easily be incorporated into existing wearable devices. To this end, we propose an index, the inflection and harmonic area ratio (IHAR), from standard photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals, which can be used to continuously monitor CO. We evaluate the success of our index by testing on sixteen normotensive subjects before and after bicycle exercise. The results showed a strong intra-subject correlation between IHAR and COimpmeasured by the bio-impedance method in fifteen subjects (mean r = 0.82, p{\textless}0.01). After least squares linear regression, the precision between COimpand CO estimated from IHAR (COIHAR) was 1.40 L/min. The total percentage error of the results was 16.2{\%}, which was well below the clinical acceptance limit of 30{\%}. The results suggest that IHAR is a promising indicator for wearable and noninvasive CO monitoring. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Objectives: Acceleration plethysmograms (APGs) are obtained by taking the second derivative of photoplethysmograms (PPGs) and are noninvasive circulatory signals related to risk factors for atherosclerosis with age. There has been growing interest in the development of mobile devices to collect and analyze PPG single features for ambulatory health monitoring. The present study aimed to extract a new feature from the morphologies of APG and PPG signals to classify the dominant indices related to the pulsatile volume of blood in tissue according to age. Methods: Ten APG and 14 PPG indices were simultaneously extracted. All indices were compared via Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and a regression analysis. We introduced a combined index extracted from both the PPG and APG indices defined as the inflection point area plus the d{\_}peak (IPAD). The participants included 93 healthy adults aged 36–86 years with a mean ± standard deviation age of 57.43 ± 11.99 years. Results: The d{\_}peak and age index for the APG indices were significantly correlated with age (r = –0.408, p {\textless} 0.0001 and r = 0.296, p = 0.0039, respectively). Only the A1 time for PPG indices was moderately correlated with age (r = –0.247, p = 0.017). The stiffness index, including individual height information, was not related to age (r = –0.031, p = 0.7713). However, the combined IPAD index was significantly more correlated with age (r = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.001) than the other indices. Conclusions: The proposed index outperformed the other 24 indices for evaluating vascular aging. We suggest that the IPAD is a significant factor related to the clinical information embedded in the PPG waveform.},

SIDVP has been previously correlated with cfPWV (carotid-femoral PWV), however, the inguinal location of the employed transducer provokes a strong psychological impact on the patients, which may reduce reproducibility.

abstract = {1. Arterial stiffness is an important determinant of cardiovascular risk. Augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness derived from the ascending aortic pressure waveform. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of heart rate on AIx. We elected to use cardiac pacing rather than chronotropic drugs to minimize confounding effects on the systemic circulation and myocardial contractility. 2. Twenty-two subjects (13 male) with a mean age of 63 years and permanent cardiac pacemakers in situ were studied. Pulse wave analysis was used to determine central arterial pressure waveforms, non-invasively, during incremental pacing (from 60 to 110 beats min-1), from which AIx and central blood pressure were calculated. Peripheral blood pressure was recorded non-invasively from the brachial artery. 3. There was a significant, inverse, linear relationship between AIx and heart rate (r = -0.76; P {\textless} 0.001). For a 10 beats min-1 increment, AIx fell by around 4{\%}. Ejection duration and heart rate were also inversely related (r = -0.51; P {\textless} 0.001). 4. Peripheral systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure increased significantly during incremental pacing. Although central diastolic pressure increased significantly with pacing, central systolic pressure did not. There was a significant increase in the ratio of peripheral to central pulse pressure (P {\textless} 0.001), which was accounted for by the observed change in central pressure augmentation. 5. These results demonstrate an inverse, linear relationship between AIx and heart rate. This is likely to be due to alterations in the timing of the reflected pressure wave, produced by changes in the absolute duration of systole. Consideration of wave reflection and aortic pressure augmentation may explain the lack of rise in central systolic pressure during incremental pacing despite an increase in peripheral pressure.},

abstract = {The stiffness of the aorta can be determined by measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVcf). PWV may also influence the contour of the peripheral pulse, suggesting that contour analysis might be used to assess large artery stiffness. An index of large artery stiffness (SIDVP) derived from the digital volume pulse (DVP) measured by transmission of IR light (photoplethysmography) was examined. SIDVP was obtained from subject height and from the time delay between direct and reflected waves in the DVP. The timing of these components of the DVP is determined by PWV in the aorta and large arteries. SIDVP was, therefore, expected to provide a measure of stiffness similar to PWV. SIDVP was compared with PWVcf obtained by applanation tonometry in 87 asymptomatic subjects (21-68 years; 29 women). The reproducibility of SIDVP and PWVcf and the response of SIDVP to glyceryl trinitrate were assessed in subsets of subjects. The mean within-subject coefficient of variation of SIDVP, for measurements at weekly intervals, was 9.6{\%}. SIDVP was correlated with PWVcf (r = 0.65, P {\textless} 0.0001). SIDVP and PWVcf were each independently correlated with age and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) with similar regression coefficients: SIDVP = 0.63+0.086 × age + 0.042 × MAP (r = 0.69, P {\textless} 0.0001); PWVcf= 0.76 + 0.080 × age + 0.053 × MAP (r = 0.71, P {\textless} 0.0001). Administration of glyceryl trinitrate (3, 30 and 300 $\mu$g/min intravenous; each dose for 15 min) in nine healthy men produced similar changes in SIDVP and PWVcf. Thus contour analysis of the DVP provides a simple, reproducible, non-invasive measure of large artery stiffness.},

abstract = {Arterial stiffening is the most important cause of increasing systolic and pulse pressure, and for decreasing diastolic pressure beyond 40 years of age. Stiffening affects predominantly the aorta and proximal elastic arteries, and to a lesser degree the peripheral muscular arteries. While conceptually a Windkessel model is the simplest way to visualize the cushioning function of arteries, this is not useful clinically under changing conditions when effects of wave reflection become prominent. Many measures have been applied to quantify stiffness, but all are approximations only, on account of the nonhomogeneous structure of the arterial wall, its variability in different locations, at different levels of distending pressure, and with changes in smooth muscle tone. This article summarizes the methods and indices used to estimate arterial stiffness, and provides values from a survey of the literature, followed by recommendations of an international group of workers in the field who attended the First Consensus Conference on Arterial Stiffness, which was held in Paris during 2000, under the chairmanship of M.E.

abstract = {To assess the role of arterial wave reflections in the mechanism of systolic hypertension and altered pulsatile arterial dynamics in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 79 ESRD patients were compared with 73 age-matched control subjects with normal renal function and similar mean blood pressure. Wave reflections were investigated from the carotid pulse contour recorded by applanation tonometry using a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe. Wave reflections were quantified as the ratio (augmentation index, {\%}) of the height of the late systolic peak to the total height of carotid pulse wave. Travel time of the reflected wave was timed from the foot of the pressure wave to the foot of the late systolic peak. Systolic and pulse pressure were increased in ESRD patients (p{\textless}0.001) and was not attributable to differences in left ventricular ejection pattern. The augmentation index was increased in ESRD patients (23.2±15.0 versus 9.8±15.6{\%};p{\textless}0.001) in association with a shorter travel time of reflected wave (109±24 versus 131±30 msec; p{\textless}0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed two principal factors associated ( p{\textless}0.001) with the increase in augmentation index and shortened travel time of reflected wave: increased aortic pulse wave velocity and smaller stature with shorter body height in ESRD patients. The study points to the role of arterial wave reflections in the mechanisms producing alterations in pulsatile arterial dynamics in ESRD and is the first, through the mechanisms of early wave reflections, to show in humans that the increase in systolic and pulse pressures is associated with lesser body size.},

abstract = {Brachial blood pressure is predictive of cardiovascular outcome; however central pressure may better represent the load imposed on the coronary and cerebral arteries and thereby bear a stronger relationship to vascular damage and prognosis.

Central pressures were calculated using radial applanation tonometry.

Central pulse pressure was more strongly related to all 3 arterial measures than was brachial pulse pressure (r=0.364 versus 0.309 for plaque score; P{\textless}0.001 for comparison of Spearman correlation coefficient; r=0.293 versus 0.249 for intimal-medial thickness; P{\textless}0.002; r=0.320 versus 0.289 for vascular mass; P{\textless}0.05).

After adjustment for age, gender, current smoking, body mass index, cholesterol:HDL ratio, creatinine, fibrinogen, diabetes, and heart rate, central pulse pressure predicted cardiovascular events more strongly than brachial pulse pressure (hazards ratio=1.15 per 10 mm Hg, $\chi$=13.4, P{\textless}0.001 versus hazards ratio=1.10, $\chi$=6.9, P=0.008). In conclusion, noninvasively-determined central pulse pressure is more strongly related to vascular hypertrophy, extent of atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events than is brachial blood pressure. These findings support prospective examination of use of central blood pressure as a treatment target in future trials. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction of CVD is urgently important for timely prevention and treatment. Incorporation or modification of new risk factors that have an additional independent prognostic value of existing prediction models is widely used for improving the performance of the prediction models. This paper is to investigate the physiological parameters that are used as risk factors for the prediction of cardiovascular events, as well as summarizing the current status on the medical devices for physiological tests and discuss the potential implications for promoting CVD prevention and treatment in the future. The results show that measures extracted from blood pressure, electrocardiogram, arterial stiffness, ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), and blood glucose carry valuable information for the prediction of both long-term and near-term cardiovascular risk. However, the predictive values should be further validated by more comprehensive measures. Meanwhile, advancing unobtrusive technologies and wireless communication technologies allow on-site detection of the physiological information remotely in an out-of-hospital setting in real-time. In addition with computer modeling technologies and information fusion. It may allow for personalized, quantitative, and real-time assessment of sudden CVD events. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wan-Hua Lin et al.},

abstract = {Background: Central blood pressure (CBP) has been reported to be superior to brachial blood pressure (BP) as a cardiovascular risk predictor in hypertensive patients; however, the effects of antihypertensives on CBP have not been fully examined. This cross-sectional hypothesis-generating study aimed to tentatively characterize all classes of antihypertensives in relation to CBP. Methods: Calibrated tonometric radial artery pressure waveforms were recorded using an automated device in 1,727 treated hypertensive patients and 848 nonhypertensive (non-HT) participants. Radial artery late systolic BP (SBP) has been reported to reflect central SBP. The difference between late and peak SBPs ($\Delta$SBP2) was assessed with linear regression model-based adjustments. Separate regression models for $\Delta$SBP2 were constructed for both participant groups as well as specified sub-populations. Results: $\Delta$SBP2 was 3.3mmHg lower in patients treated with any single-vasodilating (VD) antihypertensive agent without significant interclass difference than with non-VD agents, and was 2.0mmHg lower than estimated in nonhypertensive subjects. Combinations of two vasodilators were 6.6 and 2.9mmHg lower in $\Delta$SBP2 than nonvasodilator combinations and nonhypertensive subjects, respectively (P 0.001 for all comparisons). Nonvasodilators and their combination showed high $\Delta$SBP2, 1.1 and 3.7mmHg higher than in nonhypertensive subjects (P 0.001 for both). Additional adjustment of the pulse rate reduced high $\Delta$SBP2 with Β-blockers (ΒBLs). Conclusions: This cross-sectional observation suggests that vasodilatory antihypertensives lower CBP independently of peripheral BP levels without evident class-specific differences, whereas nonvasodilators may raise CBP. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {Objectives: The present study investigated whether central blood pressure (BP) predicts cardiovascular (CV) events better than brachial BP in a cohort of normotensive and untreated hypertensive elderly individuals. Background: Limited and conflicting data have been reported on the prognostic relevance of central BP compared with brachial BP. Methods: Community-dwelling individuals ≥65 years of age, living in Dicomano, Italy, underwent an extensive clinical assessment in 1995 including echocardiography and carotid ultrasonography and applanation tonometry. In 2003, vital status and CV events were assessed, reviewing the electronic database of the Regional Ministry of Health. Only normotensive (n = 173) and untreated hypertensive subjects (95 diastolic and 130 isolated systolic) were included in the present analysis. Results: During 8 years, 106 deaths, 45 of which were cardiovascular, and 122 CV events occurred. In univariate analyses, both central and brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) predicted CV events (all p {\textless} 0.005); however, in multivariate analyses, adjusting for age and gender, higher carotid SBP and PP (hazard ratios 1.19/10 and 1.23/10 mm Hg, respectively; both p {\textless} 0.0001) but neither brachial SBP nor PP independently predicted CV events. Similarly, higher carotid SBP but not brachial pressures independently predicted CV mortality (hazard ratio 1.37/10 mm Hg; p {\textless} 0.0001).

abstract = {Arterial pressure waves were recorded noninvasively from the carotid, radial, femoral, or all three of these arteries of 1,005 normal subjects, aged 2-91 years, using a new transcutaneous tonometer containing a high fidelity Millar micromanometer. Waves were ensemble-averaged into age-decade groups. Characteristic changes were noted with increasing age. In all sites, pulse amplitude increased with advancing age (carotid, 91.3{\%}; radial 67.5{\%}; femoral, 50.1{\%} from first to eighth decade), diastolic decay steepened, and diastolic waves became less prominent. In the carotid pulse, there was, in youth, a second peak on th downstroke of the waves in late systole. After the third decade, this second peak rose with age to merge with and dominate the initial rise. In the radial pulse, a late systolic wave was also apparent, but this occurred later; with age, this second peak rose but not above the initial rise in early systole, even at the eighth decade. In the femoral artery, there was a single systolic wave at all ages. Aging changes in the arterial pulse are explicable on the basis of both an increase in arterial stiffness with increased pulse-wave velocity and progressively earlier wave reflection. These two factors may be separated and effects of the latter measured from pressure wave-contour analysis using an 'augmentation index', determined by a computer algorithm developed from invasive pressure and flow data. Changes in peak pressure in the central (carotid) artery show increasing cardiac afterload with increasing age in a normal population; this can account for the cardiac hypertrophy that occurs with advancing age (even as other organs atrophy) and the predisposition to cardiac failure in the elderly. Identification of mechanisms responsible offers a new approach to reduction of left ventricular afterload.},

abstract = {The relationship between the shape of the ascending aortic pressure wave form and aortic input impedance was studied in 18 patients who underwent elective cardiac catheterization but in whom no heart disease was found. Ascending aortic flow velocity and pressure were simultaneously recorded from a multisensor catheter with an electromagnetic velocity probe and a pressure sensor mounted at the same location. Another pressure sensor at the catheter tip provided left ventricular pressure or a second aortic pressure to determine pulse-wave velocity. Fick cardiac outputs were used to scale the velocity signal to instantaneous volumetric flow. Input impedance was calculated from 10 harmonics of aortic pressure and flow. For each patient, impedance moduli and phases from a minimum of 15 beats during a steady state were averaged. Peripheral resistance was 1137 ± 39 dyn-sec-cm-5 (± SEM) and characteristic impedance was 47 ± 4 dyn-sec-cm-5; pulse-wave velocity was 6.68 ± 0.32 m-sec-1. In all patients, a well-defined systolic infection point divided the aortic pressure wave form into an early and late systolic phase. The patients were classified into three groups: group A (n=7) - patients whose late systolic pressure exceeded early systolic pressure; group B (n = 7) - patients whose early and late systolic pressures were nearly equal: group C (n=4) - patients whose early systolic pressure exceeded late systolic pressure. Group A and B patients all demonstrated oscillations of the impedance moduli about the characteristic impedance. Group C patients demonstrated flatter impedance spectra. Thus, a larger secondary rise in pressure was associated with a more oscillatory impedance spectrum. These results suggest that the differences in pressure wave forms are due to differences in reflections in the arterial tree and not secondary to differences in cardiac function. Using pulse-wave velocity, the 'effective' reflection site distance was determined from both pressure (48 cm) and impedance (44 cm) data, implying that the region of the terminal abdominal aorta acts as the major reflection site in normal adult man.},

abstract = {Introduction: Arterial stiffness is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and can be assessed by applanation tonometry by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIX) by pressure pulse wave analysis (PWA). As an inexpensive and operator independent alternative, photoelectric plethysmography (PPG) has been introduced with analysis of the digital volume pulse wave (DPA) and its second derivatives of wave reflections. Objective: The objective was to investigate the repeatability of arterial stiffness parameters measured by digital pulse wave analysis (DPA) and the associations to applanation tonometry parameters. Methods and Results: 112 pregnant and non-pregnant individuals of different ages and genders were examined with SphygmoCor arterial wall tonometry and Meridian DPA finger photoplethysmography. Coefficients of repeatability, Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients and correlations to heart rate (HR) and body height were calculated for DPA variables, and the DPA variables were compared to tonometry variables left ventricular ejection time (LVET), PWV and AIX. No DPA variable showed any systematic measurement error or excellent repeatability, but dicrotic index (DI), dicrotic dilatation index (DDI), cardiac ejection elasticity index (EEI), aging index (AI) and second derivatives of the crude pulse wave curve, b/a and e/a, showed good repeatability. Overall, the correlations to AIX were better than to PWV, with correlations coefficients {\textgreater}0.70 for EEI, AI and b/a. Considering the level of repeatability and the correlations to tonometry, the overall best DPA parameters were EEI, AI and b/a. The two pansystolic time parameters, ejection time compensated (ETc) by DPA and LVET by tonometry, showed a significant but weak correlation. Conclusion: For estimation of the LV function, ETc, EEI and b/a are suitable, for large artery stiffness EEI, and for small arteries DI and DDI. The only global parameter, AI, showed a high repeatability and the overall best correlations with AIX and PWV.},

For this purpose, PPG signals were recorded from 24 healthy subjects and from 20 type II diabetes patients. The recorded PPG signals were processed with the analysis algorithm developed and the waveform index PPGAI similar to the augmentation index (AIx) was calculated. As a reference, the aortic AIx was assessed and normalized for a heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@75) by a SphygmoCor device. A strong correlation (r = 0.85) between the PPGAI and the aortic AIx@75 and a positive correlation of both indices with age were found. Age corrections for the indices PPGAI and AIx@75 as regression models from the signals of healthy subjects were constructed. Both indices revealed a significant difference between the groups of diabetes patients and healthy controls. However, the PPGAI provided the best statistical discrimination for the group of subjects with increased arterial stiffness. The waveform index PPGAI based on the inexpensive PPG technology can be considered as a perspective measure of increased arterial stiffness estimation in clinical screenings.},

abstract = {Background-:Various measures of arterial stiffness and wave reflection have been proposed as cardiovascular risk markers. Prior studies have not assessed relations of a comprehensive panel of stiffness measures to prognosis in the community. Methods and Results-: We used proportional hazards models to analyze first-onset major cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, or stroke) in relation to arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]), wave reflection (augmentation index, carotid-brachial pressure amplification), and central pulse pressure in 2232 participants (mean age, 63 years; 58{\%} women) in the Framingham Heart Study. During median follow-up of 7.8 (range, 0.2 to 8.9) years, 151 of 2232 participants (6.8{\%}) experienced an event. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive therapy, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, smoking, and presence of diabetes mellitus, higher aortic PWV was associated with a 48{\%} increase in cardiovascular disease risk (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.91 per SD; P=0.002). After PWV was added to a standard risk factor model, integrated discrimination improvement was 0.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.05{\%} to 1.3{\%}; P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, augmentation index, central pulse pressure, and pulse pressure amplification were not related to cardiovascular disease outcomes in multivariable models. Conclusions-: Higher aortic stiffness assessed by PWV is associated with increased risk for a first cardiovascular event. Aortic PWV improves risk prediction when added to standard risk factors and may represent a valuable biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk in the community. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals also reflect the cardiac rhythm since the mechanical activity of the heart is coupled to its electrical activity. Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive, safe, and easy-to-use technique that has been developed for experimental use in vascular disease. A useful algorithm for a-wave detection in the acceleration plethysmogram (APG, the second derivative of the PPG) is introduced to determine the interval between successive heartbeats and heart rate variability. In this study, finger-tip PPG signals were recorded for twenty seconds from 27 healthy subjects measured at rest. The use of the aa interval in APG signals showed very promising results in calculating the HRV statistical indices, SDNN and rMSSD. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Background: The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa strained existing healthcare systems well beyond their capacities due to the extreme volume and severity of illness of the patients. The implementation of innovative digital technologies within available care centres could potentially improve patient care as well as healthcare worker safety and effectiveness. Methods: We developed a Modular Wireless Patient Monitoring System (MWPMS) and conducted a proof of concept study in an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Makeni, Sierra Leone. The system was built around a wireless, multiparametric ‘band-aid' patch sensor for continuous vital sign monitoring and transmission, plus sophisticated data analytics. Results were used to develop personalised analytics to support automated alerting of early changes in patient status. Results: During the 3-week study period, all eligible patients (n=26) admitted to the ETC were enrolled in the study, generating a total of 1838 hours of continuous vital sign data (mean of 67.8 hours/ patient), including heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, respiratory rate, pulse transit time (inversely related to blood pressure), uncalibrated skin temperature and posture. All patients tolerated the patch sensor without problems. Manually determined and automated vital signs were well correlated. Algorithm-generated Multivariate Change Index, pulse transit time and arrhythmia burden demonstrated encouraging preliminary findings of important physiological changes, as did ECG waveform changes. Conclusions: In this proof of concept study, we were able to demonstrate that a portable, deployable system for continuous vital sign monitoring via a wireless, wearable sensor supported by a sophisticated, personalised analytics platform can provide high-acuity monitoring with a continuous, objective measure of physiological status of all patients that is achievable in virtually any healthcare setting, anywhere in the world.},

abstract = {Casual blood pressure (BP) can predict the development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the correlations between its values and the subsequent occurrence of such complications are low. This may depend on different individual resistance to the damage produced by hypertension. However, it may also depend on the recognized inability of casual BP to reflect accurately the 24-h mean and profile BP. In order to test the latter hypothesis, 24-h BP was recorded intra-arterially (Oxford method) in 108 hospitalized subjects with essential hypertension ranging from mild to severe. The 24-h means and standard deviations (i.e. variabilities) for systolic, mean and diastolic BP obtained by computer analysis of the BP tracing were related to the rate and severity of target-organ damage (TOD) assessed by clinical examination and quantified according to a predetermined score. The results confirmed that 24-h BP may be variably different from cuff BP among subjects. For nearly any value of cuff BP, subjects in whom the 24-h mean BP was low had a lower prevalence and severity of TOD than those in whom the 24-h mean BP was high (P {\textless}0.01). Furthermore, for nearly any level of 24-h mean BP, subjects in whom the 24-h BP variability was low had a lower prevalence and severity of TOD than those in whom the 24-h BP variability was high (P 0.05). These findings demonstrate that the severity of hypertension is more closely related to 24-h mean BP than to cuff BP values. They also provide the first unequivocal demonstration that hypertension-dependent TOD also relates to the extent of BP variability. This supports the diagnostic superiority of ambulatory over more traditional BP measurements in hypertension. {\textcopyright} Gower Academic Journals.},

Recent Findings: Recent data has shown that ABPM is more strongly associated with end-organ damage than casual BP, and that obesity and secondary causes of hypertension are strongly associated with nocturnal hypertension. There is evidence that ABPM is useful in management of a larger variety of diagnoses than previously thought. New guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recognize the importance of ABPM in the management of pediatric hypertension. Summary: ABPM has an important and growing role in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in children and adolescents.

abstract = {Background: High prevalence of masked hypertension as well as persistent hypertension was observed in the Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort (CKD-JAC) study. We proposed a novel indicator of blood pressure (BP) load, hyperbaric area index (HBI), calculated from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data. The characteristic of this index and its relationship with kidney function were also evaluated. Methods: The CKD-JAC study, enrolled 2,977 patients, is a prospective observational study started in September 2007. ABPM was conducted in a sub-group from September 2007 to April 2010 and baseline ABPM data of 1,075 subjects (63.4 {\%} male, 60.7 years old) were analyzed. Results: Mean systolic HBI of male and female patients were 242.3 and 176.5 mmHg×h, respectively. HBI sensitively reflected sex (54.7 mmHg×h higher in males than in females), seasonal effects (51.6 mmHg×h higher in winter than in summer), and advancing CKD stage [(16.5 mmHg×h higher) per −10 mL/min/1.73 m2 in eGFR]. The HBI was a significant factor to associate with reduced kidney function, after adjusting with nocturnal BP change (NBPC), sex, and other variables (p value {\textless}0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that HBI might be a novel sensitive indicator for the reduction of kidney function, independent of patterns of NBPC.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between systemic vascular resistance (SVR), finger {\&} ear photoplethysmographic measurements in 14 adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: Patients were monitored with photoplethysmographs of the finger and ear and continuous cardiac output (QT) via thermodilution catheter. The relationship between SVR, finger plethysmographic amplitude, width and ear plethysmographic amplitude, width was assessed with linear regression. Results: The finger plethysmographic amplitude had a low correlation r value = -0.15, while finger plethysmographic width had a better correlation r value = 0.56. The correlation between SVR and ear plethysmographic amplitude and width were -0.24 and 0.62 respectively. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis the ear plethysmographic width had both better sensitivity and specificity than the finger plethysmographic width in identifying high and low SVR. Using a multiple regression analysis, SVR was estimated from the pulse oximeter waveforms: SVR calculated = 27.27 + (3978.53 × Ear pulse oximeter width) - (8.91 × Ear pulse oximeter area) + (1986.3 × Finger pulse oximeter width). Bland-Altman analysis was used the bias was 29.8 dynes s cm-5, standard deviation was 587.3, upper and lower limit of agreement were 1204.45, and -1144.8 dynes s cm-5 respectively. Conclusion: The data indicate that pulse width of finger and ear plethysmographic tracing are more sensitive to changes in SVR than the other indices. An appreciation of changes in pulse width may provide valuable evidence with respect to changes in peripheral vascular tone. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {There is considerable interest in non-intrusive and reliable continuous ambulatory blood pressure measurement systems. Pulse amplitude is the peak to trough amplitude of the photo-plethysmogram signal. We compared pulse amplitude with a currently popular parameter, the pulse arrival time (PAT), for estimating continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP). Overnight sleep data from 18 young, healthy subjects (14 M 4 F, age 24 ± 5 years, BMI 23.8 ± 4.0 kg/m2) was analyzed. We found that pulse amplitude was more effective than PAT for estimating SBP during sleep. Mean coherence between pulse amplitude and SBP was significantly stronger than that for PAT [p {\textless} 0.001, 95{\%} CI: 0.21-0.25 (finger), 0.11-0.14 (wrist)]. Correlation between pulse amplitude and SBP was significantly stronger than that for PAT [p {\textless} 0.001, 95{\%} CI: 0.46-0.53 (finger), 0.13-0.20 (wrist)]. SBP estimation errors were significantly lower using pulse amplitude [p {\textless} 0.001, 95{\%} CI: -1.55 to -1.29 mmHg (finger), -0.53 to -0.36 mmHg (wrist)]. We also found that while pulse amplitude was closely related to SBP, the relationship weakened during and around REM sleep (ANOVA of REM, transitional Wake-REM and transitional REM-Sleep versus other sleep states: F = 24.7, p {\textless} 0.001). These results suggest that pulse amplitude is potentially a more suitable measure than pulse arrival time for estimating continuous blood pressure. {\textcopyright} 2010 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {Several parameters of the cardiovascular system fluctuate spontaneously owing to the activity of the autonomic nervous system. In the study, the simultaneous very low frequency (VLF) fluctuations of the arterial blood pressure, the tissue blood content and the tissue blood volume pulse are investigated. The latter two parameters are derived from the baseline BL and the amplitude AM of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal, measured on the fingertips of 20 healthy male subjects: the changes in the PPG parameters AM and BV, defined by BV = const. - BL, are related to the change in the tissue blood volume pulse and the total tissue blood volume, respectively. The VLF fluctuations in BV and AM are directly correlated, those of AM preceding those of BV by 4-13 heart-beats. The VLF fluctuations in the systolic (SBP) and the diastolic (DBP) blood pressure are inversely correlated to those of AM and BV, those of AM preceding those of SBP and lagging behind those of DBP by about one heart-beat. For most subjects, the period P of the PPG pulse, which is equal to the cardiac cycle period, directly correlates with AM and BV and inversely correlates with DBP and SBP. On average, the fluctuations of P precede those of AM by more than three heart-beats. The measurement of the VLF fluctuations in tissue blood volume, systolic blood volume pulse, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and heart period, together with their interrelationship, can provide a better understanding of the autonomic nervous control of the peripheral circulation and a potential tool for the evaluation of its function.},

abstract = {Sepsis is associated with impairment in autonomic regulatory function. This work investigates the application of heart rate and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform variability analysis in differentiating two categories of sepsis, namely systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and severe sepsis. Electrocardiogram-derived heart period (RRi) and PPG waveforms, measured from fingertips (Fin-PPG) and earlobes (Ear-PPG), of Emergency Department sepsis patients (n = 28) with different disease severity, were analysed by spectral technique, and were compared to control subjects (n = 10) in supine and 80° head-up tilted positions. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied to adjust for the confounding factor of age. Low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), mid-frequency (MF, 0.09-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0.60 Hz) powers were computed. The normalised MF power in Ear-PPG (MFnuEar) was significantly reduced in severe sepsis patients with hyperlactataemia (lactate {\textgreater} 2 mmol/l), compared to SIRS patients (P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, in a group of normal controls, MFnuEar was not altered by head-up tilting (P {\textgreater} 0.05), suggesting that there may be a link between 0.1 Hz ear blood flow oscillation and tissue metabolic changes in sepsis, in addition to autonomic factors. The study highlighted the value of PPG spectral analysis in the non-invasive assessment of peripheral vascular regulation in sepsis patients, with potential implications in monitoring the progression of sepsis. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

Its continuous monitoring is considered to be a valuable hypovolumia prognostic parameter and an important risk predictor in cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac and light chain amyloidosis. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for the assessment of LVET based the Photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform. We propose the use of Gaussian functions to model both systolic and diastolic phases of the PPG beat and consequently determine the onset and offset of the systolic ejection from the analysis of the systolic phase 3rdderivative. The results achieved by the proposed methodology were compared with the algorithm proposed by Chan et al. [1], revealing better estimation of LVET (15.84 ± 13.56 ms vs 23.01 ± 14.60 ms), and similar correlation with the echocardiographic reference (0.73 vs 0.75). {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {To evaluate the clinical application of the second derivative of the fingertip photoplethysmogram waveform, we performed drug administration studies (study 1) and epidemiological studies (study 2). In study 1, scending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean±SD age of 54±11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 $\mu$g angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40±0.13 to -0.62±0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to - 0.25±0.12 (P{\textless}0.001 and P{\textless}O.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P{\textless}0.001, and r=0.80, P{\textless}0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P{\textless}0.001, y=0.023x-l.515). The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06±0.36 versus -0.22±0.41, P{\textless}0.01). Women had a higher aging index than men (P{\textless}0.01). The b-c-d-e/a ratio may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging and for screening of arteriosclerotic disease.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess whether recording of ambulatory blood pressure at night causes arousal from sleep and a change in the continuous blood pressure recorded simultaneously. Design: Repeated measurement of blood pressure with two ambulatory blood pressure machines (Oxford Medical ABP and A{\&}D TM2420) during continuous measurement of beat to beat blood pressure and continuous electroencephalography. Setting: Sleep reseach laboratory. Subjects-Six normal subjects. Main outcome measures: The duration of electroencephalographic arousal and the beat to beat changes in blood pressure produced by the measurement of ambulatory blood pressure; the size of any changes that this arousal and change in blood pressure produced in the blood pressure recorded by the ambulatory machine. Results: Both ambulatory blood pressure machines caused arousal from sleep: The mean duration of arousal was 16 seconds (95{\%} range 0-202) with the ABP and 8 seconds (0-73) with the TM2420. Both also caused a rise in beat to beat blood pressure. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, this rise led to the ABP machine overestimating the true systolic blood pressure during sleep by a mean of 10 (SD 14.8) mm Hg and the TM2420 by a mean of 6.3 (8.2) mm Hg. On average, diastolic pressure was not changed, but measurements in individual subjects changed by up to 23 mm Hg. These changes varied in size among subjects and stages of sleep and were seen after measurements that did not cause any electroencephalographic arousal. Conclusions: Ambulatory blood pressure machines cause appreciable arousal from sleep and therefore alter the blood pressure that they are trying to record. This effect should be taken into account when recordings of blood pressure at night are interpreted in clinical work and epidemiological research. {\textcopyright} 1994, BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often associated with hypertension and other cardio-vascular diseases. Blood pressure (BP) variability is part of the assessment of cardiovascular risk. In OSA, BP variability has been studied mainly as very short-term (beat-by-beat) and short-term (24-hour BP profile) variability. BP measured on consecutive heartbeats has been demonstrated to be highly variable, due to repeated peaks during sleep, so that an accurate assessment of nocturnal BP levels in OSA may require peculiar methodologies. In 24-hour recordings, BP frequently features a "nondipping" profile, ie, {\textless}10{\%} fall from day to night, which may increase cardiovascular risk and occurrence of major cardiovascular events in the nocturnal hours. Also, BP tends to show a large "morning BP surge", a still controversial negative prognostic sign. Increased very short-term BP variability, high morning BP, and nondipping BP profile appear related to the severity of OSA. Treatment of OSA slightly reduces mean 24-hour BP levels and nocturnal beat-by-beat BP variability by abolishing nocturnal BP peaks. In some patients OSA treatment turns a nondipping into a dipping BP profile. Treatment of arterial hypertension in OSA usually requires both antihypertensive pharmacological therapy and treatment of apnea. Addressing BP variability could help improve the management of OSA and reduce cardiovascular risk. Possibly, drug administration at an appropriate time would ensure a dipping-BP profile.},

abstract = {Objective: Examine the relationship between home blood pressure (BP) and risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of home BP. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events. We extracted hazard ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) which were pooled with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. Results: We identified eight studies with 17 698 participants. Follow-up was 3.2-10.9 years. For all-cause mortality (n = 747) the hazard ratio for home BP was 1.14 (95{\%} CI 1.01-1.29) per 10 mmHg increase in systolic BP compared to 1.07 (0.91-1.26) for office BP. For cardiovascular mortality (n = 193) the hazard ratio for home BP was 1.29 (1.02-1.64) per 10 mmHg increase in systolic BP compared to 1.15 (0.91-1.46) for office BP. For cardiovascular events (n = 699) the hazard ratio for home BP was 1.14 (1.09-1.20) per 10 mmHg increase in systolic BP compared to 1.10 (1.06-1.15) for office BP. In three studies which adjusted for office and home BP the hazard ratio was 1.20 (1.11-1.30) per 10 mmHg increase in systolic BP for home BP adjusted for office BP compared to 0.99 (0.93-1.07) per 10 mmHg increase in systolic BP for office BP adjusted for home BP. Diastolic results were similar. Conclusions: Home BP remained a significant predictor of cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events after adjusting for office BP suggesting it is an important prognostic variable over and above that of office BP. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the multivariate-adjusted predictive value of systolic and diastolic blood pressures on conventional (CBP) and daytime (10-20 h) ambulatory (ABP) measurement. METHODS: We randomly recruited 7030 subjects (mean age 56.2 years; 44.8{\%} women) from populations in Belgium, Denmark, Japan and Sweden. We constructed the International Database on Ambulatory blood pressure and Cardiovascular Outcomes. RESULTS: During follow-up (median = 9.5 years), 932 subjects died. Neither CBP nor ABP predicted total mortality, of which 60.9{\%} was due to noncardiovascular causes. The incidence of fatal combined with nonfatal cardiovascular events amounted to 863 (228 deaths, 326 strokes and 309 cardiac events). In multivariate-adjusted continuous analyses, both CBP and ABP predicted cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, cardiac and coronary events. However, in fully-adjusted models, including both CBP and ABP, CBP lost its predictive value (P ≥ 0.052), whereas systolic and diastolic ABP retained their prognostic significance (P ≤ 0.007) with the exception of diastolic ABP as predictor of cardiac and coronary events (P ≥ 0.21). In adjusted categorical analyses, normotension was the referent group (CBP {\textless} 140/90 mmHg and ABP {\textless} 135/85 mmHg). Adjusted hazard ratios for all cardiovascular events were 1.22 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.96-1.53; P = 0.09] for white-coat hypertension (≥ 140/90 and {\textless} 135/85 mmHg); 1.62 (95{\%} CI = 1.35-1.96; P {\textless} 0.0001) for masked hypertension ({\textless} 140/90 and ≥ 135/85 mmHg); and 1.80 (95{\%} CI = 1.59-2.03; P {\textless} 0.0001) for sustained hypertension (≥ 140/90 and ≥ 135/85 mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: ABP is superior to CBP in predicting cardiovascular events, but not total and noncardiovascular mortality.

@article{Chavanu2008,
abstract = {Purpose. The role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in the management of hypertension is reviewed. Summary. ABPM is a fully automated technique in which multiple blood pressure (BP) measurements are taken at regular intervals (usually every 15 to 30 minutes) over a 24-48-hour period, providing a continuous BP record during the patient's normal daily activities. Some experts advocate the use of 24-hour ABPM for all first diagnoses of hypertension and for treatment decision-making. The use of ABPM can improve BP monitoring so that treatment can be optimized more rapidly and more patients can achieve BP targets with appropriate therapy. ABPM may lead to better patient outcomes while requiring less-intensive drug regimens to maintain BP control and reducing treatment costs. By more accurately and reliably measuring BP, especially circadian changes, ABPM has been shown to predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and end-organ damage. ABPM is especially beneficial for patients whose hypertension is difficult to diagnose, including the elderly, patients with diabetes, and individuals with resistant hypertension. ABPM is also beneficial for predicting disease severity and prognosis among patients with chronic renal disease, a condition associated with significant cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, ABPM has helped differentiate the 24-hour antihypertensive efficacy of antihypertensive agents among and within differing drug classes and is also useful in drug development for determining optimal dosing. Conclusion. ABPM is an effective method for the accurate diagnosis and management of hypertension and may positively affect clinical outcomes of patients with other risk factors for cardiovascular events.

abstract = {Objective-To review the literature systematically and perform meta-analyses to address these questions: 1) Is there evidence that self-measured blood pressure (BP) without other augmentation is superior to office-based measurement of BP for achieving better BP control or for preventing adverse clinical outcomes that are related to elevated BP? 2) What is the optimal target for BP lowering during antihypertensive therapy in adults? 3) In adults with hypertension, how do various antihypertensive drug classes differ in their benefits and harms compared with each other as first-line therapy? Methods-Electronic literature searches were performed by Doctor Evidence, a global medical evidence software and services company, across PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to 2015 using key words and relevant subject headings for randomized controlled trials that met eligibility criteria defined for each question. We performed analyses using traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches, including random-effects Bayesian network meta-analyses. Results-Our results suggest that: 1) There is a modest but significant improvement in systolic BP in randomized controlled trials of self-measured BP versus usual care at 6 but not 12 months, and for selected patients and their providers self-measured BP may be a helpful adjunct to routine office care. 2) systolic BP lowering to a target of {\textless}130 mm Hg may reduce the risk of several important outcomes including risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and major cardiovascular events. No class of medications (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers) was significantly better than thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics as a first-line therapy for any outcome.},

abstract = {Being one of the most widely prevalent diseases throughout the world, hypertension has emerged as one of the leading causes of global premature morbidity and mortality. Hence, blood pressure (BP) measurements are essential for physicians in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend initiating antihypertensive medications on the basis of office BP readings. However, office BP readings provide a snapshot evaluation of the patient's BP, which might not reflect patient's true BP, with the possibility of being falsely elevated or falsely low. Recently, there is ample evidence to show that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a better predictor of major cardiovascular events than BP measurements at clinic settings. ABPM helps in reducing the number of possible false readings, along with the added benefit of understanding the dynamic variability of BP. This article will focus on the significance of ambulatory BP, its advantages and limitations compared with the standard office BP measurement and a brief outlook on its use and interpretation to diagnose and treat hypertension.},

Home and ambulatory measurements are widely used, both to confirm the diagnosis and to improve adherence to therapy. The major advantage of out-of-office blood pressure monitoring is that it provides a large number of blood pressure measurements away from the medical environment, which represents a more reliable assessment of actual blood pressure than office blood pressure. The advantage of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is its unique ability to measure nocturnal blood pressure. Although not fully validated in large-scale clinical trials, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring appears to correlate best with prognosis. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring provide somewhat different information on the subject's blood pressure status, and the two methods should thus be regarded as complementary, rather than competitive or alternative. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society of Nephrology.},

The negative impact of masked hypertension on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is evidenced by numerous well-designed clinic-based and population-based studies. The relationship of masked hypertension and target organ damage is also well documented. These two factors, combined with the robust evidence of reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality achieved with blood pressure treatment, makes the argument for actively identifying patients with masked hypertension and prescribing treatment similar to that for patients with sustained hypertension. In this paper, we review the evidence for the cardiovascular prognosis of masked hypertension compared with sustained hypertension, we review its impact on target organ damage, we propose an algorithm for the treatment of patients with masked hypertension, and we point out the pitfalls in adopting such an approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of our study was to find out factors associated with patient acceptance of repeat 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using the Mobil-O-Graph ambulatory blood pressure monitor. Methods: Six hundred and fifty patients had ABPM performed between July 1999 and Oct 2000. Following 24 h ABPM patients were asked to complete 13-item questionnaire. Results: Ninety-five percent of the patients were willing to have 24 h ABPM repeated. There was no relation to patient's refusal to further ABPM with gender, age, height, weight, BMI, arm circumference, clinic blood pressure or 24 h ABPM profile. Patients were unlikely to have 24 h ABPM repeated if they found the monitor heavy and cumbersome (68{\%}), if the monitor interfered with sleep (45{\%}), or if they were so disturbed by the 24 h ABPM that they considered switching the monitor off (93{\%}). Conclusions: Most patients were willing to have repeat ABPM using the Mobil-O-Graph and reported few problems with monitor noise, heaviness and interference with sleep. These factors however still remain significant and need more technological attention and innovation from the manufacturers. {\textcopyright} 2003 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is probably becoming a clinically useful procedure for the evaluation of hypertensive patients. Previous reports have shown that the devices are safe and serious side effects are rare. Discomfort and inconveniences associated with its use are more frequent. In this study, patient acceptance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was compared with acceptance of other diagnostic procedures and their side effects were assessed. Patients were asked to fill in a form and 129 of 166 patients responded. The acceptance was measured with a visual analogue scale which ranged from 'very annoying' on the left to 'not annoying at all' on the right. All forms were collected anonymously. Mean distance (cm) of the visual likert scale was 8.6 to 9.4 for the diagnostic procedures frequently used in routine patient care. Ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) scored 6.1 cm. Reported side effects (in 27{\%} of patients) were: pain (9{\%}), skin irritation (8{\%}), noisy device (8{\%}), inconvenience with work (3{\%}), haematoma (2{\%}) and other (4{\%}). Reports from the patients on sleep quality were: 23{\%} normal, 61{\%} minor disturbance, 14{\%} bad sleep, and 2{\%} did not sleep at all. It can be concluded that ambulatory BP monitoring was the diagnostic procedure with the lowest patient acceptance. Side effects of this new technology were reported by 27{\%} of patients. However, risks are relatively minor. Sleep disturbances were very frequent and was a serious problem for 16{\%} of patients.},

abstract = {Background: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is increasingly used to measure blood pressure (BP) in research studies. We examined ease of use, comfort, degree of disturbance, reported adverse effects, factors associated with poor tolerability, and association of poor tolerability with data acquisition of 24-hour ABPM using the Oscar 2 monitor in the research setting. Methods. Sixty adults participating in a research study of people with a history of borderline clinic BP reported on their experience with ABPM on two occasions one week apart. Poor tolerability was operationalized as an overall score at or above the 75th percentile using responses to questions adapted from a previously developed questionnaire. In addition to descriptive statistics (means for responses to Likert-scaled "0 to 10" questions and proportions for Yes/No questions), we examined reproducibility of poor tolerability as well as associations with poor tolerability and whether poor tolerability was associated with removal of the monitor or inadequate number of BP measurements. Results: The mean ambulatory BP of participants by an initial ABPM session was 148/87 mm Hg. After wearing the monitor the first time, the degree to which the monitor was felt to be cumbersome ranged from a mean of 3.0 to 3.8, depending on whether at work, home, driving, or other times. The most bother was interference with normal sleeping pattern (mean 4.2). Wearers found the monitor straightforward to use (mean 7.5). Nearly 67{\%} reported that the monitor woke them after falling asleep, and 8.6{\%} removed it at some point during the night. Reported adverse effects included pain (32{\%}), skin irritation (37{\%}), and bruising (7{\%}). Those categorized as having poor tolerability (kappa = 0.5 between sessions, p = 0.0003) were more likely to report being in fair/poor health (75{\%} vs 22{\%}, p = 0.01) and have elevated 24-hour BP average (systolic: 28{\%} vs 17{\%}, p = 0.56; diastolic: 30{\%} vs 17{\%}, p = 0.37). They were also more likely to remove the monitor and have inadequate numbers of measurements. Conclusions: The Oscar 2 ABPM device is straightforward to use but can interfere with sleep. Commonly reported adverse effects include pain, skin irritation, and bruising. Those who tolerate the monitor poorly are more likely to report being in fair or poor health and to remove it, particularly at night. {\textcopyright} 2011 Viera et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: To establish the acceptability and tolerance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Methods: A two-part questionnaire was completed by the doctor; one part before ABPM and the second after the recording. The pre-recording data concern the demographic data of the patient: previous illness, symptoms, reaction of the patient, anthropometric data, treatment details and the reason for ABPM. The second part of the questionnaire records the type of monitor used, the conditions of the recording and any difficulties for, or adverse effects on, the patient. Subjects: Six hundred and seventy-two patients considered hypertensive by World Health Organization criteria (diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg), were considered for the first descriptive part of the study; a total of 654 patients were considered for the second part related to tolerance; 18 patients refused to reply to the questions concerning the second questionnaire. The general characteristics of the population were as follows: 345 men (51.5{\%}), 327 women (48.5{\%}) and mean age 54 ± 15 years. Results: The devices used were SpaceLabs (63{\%}), Novacor (19.3{\%}), Nippon Collin (6.3{\%}) and other machines (11.2{\%}). The difficulties caused by the machine were classified as 'nul', 'moderate' or 'important'. The levels of difficulty defined as 'important' were 32{\%} related to the cuff, 14{\%} to the awkwardness of the machine and 6{\%} to the noise of the monitor. Difficulty in driving was reported in 9{\%} of cases and difficulty related to comments by colleagues in 6{\%}. Analysis during sleep hindered sleep in 55{\%}, with a very disturbed sleep pattern (more than three reported awakenings) in 14{\%} of cases. Regression analysis allowed examination of the links among the different variables, taking into account the type of machine or the profile of the subject. Thus, it was possible to differentiate among the elements that could influence or predict intolerance. Conclusion: Recording-related problems are not negligible but can be reduced by an approach oriented towards each individual patient, taking into account specific information for particular circumstances.},

In this study, we investigate if autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models with kernel-based regularization are suited for the scope. We analyzed 10 PPG time-series acquired on different individuals by a wearable optical sensor and correspondent BP reference values to evaluate feasibility of continuous BP estimation from a single PPG source.

abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) is a cardiovascular parameter of emerging interest due to its potential to estimate blood pressure (BP) continuously and without a cuff. Both linear and nonlinear equations have been used in the estimation of BP based on PTT. This study, however, demonstrates that there is a hysteresis phenomenon between BP and PTT during and after dynamic exercise. A total of 46 subjects including 16 healthy subjects, 13 subjects with one or more cardiovascular risk factors, and 17 patients with cardiovascular disease underwent graded exercise stress test. PTT was measured from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram of the left index finger of the subject, i.e., a pathway that includes predominately aorta, brachial, and radial arteries. The results of this study showed that, for the same systolic BP (SBP), PTT measured during exercise was significantly larger than PTT measured during recovery for all subject groups. This hysteresis was further quantified as both normalized area bounded by the SBP-PTT relationship (AreaN) and SBP difference at PTT during peak exercise plus 20 ms ($\Delta$SBP20). Significant attenuation of both AreaN (p {\textless} 0.05) and $\Delta$SBP20 (p {\textless} 0.01) is observed in cardiovascular patients compared with healthy subjects, independent of resting BP. Since the SBP-PTT relationship are determined by the mechanical properties of arterial wall, which is predominately mediated by the sympathetic nervous system through altered vascular smooth muscle (VSM) tone during exercise, results of this study are consistent with the previous findings of autonomic nervous dysfunction in cardiovascular patients. We further conclude that VSM tone has a nonnegligible influence on the BP-PTT relationship and thus should be considered in the PTT-based BP estimation. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Arterial stiffness and excessive pressure pulsatility have emerged as important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Arterial stiffness increases with age and in the presence of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and lipid disorders. Pathologic stiffening of large arteries with advancing age and risk factor exposure predominantly involves the elastic aorta and carotid arteries, whereas stiffness changes are relatively limited in muscular arteries. Aortic stiffening is associated with increased pulse wave velocity and pulse pressure, which are related but distinct measures of the pulsatile energy content of the pressure waveform. A dramatic increase in pulsatile energy content of pressure and flow waves in the arterial system places considerable pulsatile stress on the heart, large arteries and distal circulation. Large artery stiffening is associated with abnormalities in microvascular structure and function that may contribute to tissue damage, particularly in susceptible high flow organs such as the brain and kidneys. This brief review summarizes results of recent research on risk factors for and adverse effects of large artery stiffening. {\textcopyright} 2009 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.},

abstract = {The present study designs an algorithm to increase the accuracy of continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation. Pulse arrival time (PAT) has been widely used for continuous BP estimation. However, because of motion artifact and physiological activities, PAT-based methods are often troubled with low BP estimation accuracy. This paper used a signal quality modified Kalman filter to track blood pressure changes. A Kalman filter guarantees that BP estimation value is optimal in the sense of minimizing the mean square error. We propose a joint signal quality indice to adjust the measurement noise covariance, pushing the Kalman filter to weigh more heavily on measurements from cleaner data. Twenty 2 h physiological data segments selected from the MIMIC II database were used to evaluate the performance. Compared with straightforward use of the PAT-based linear regression model, the proposed model achieved higher measurement accuracy. Due to low computation complexity, the proposed algorithm can be easily transplanted into wearable sensor devices.},

abstract = {Cuff-less Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring has gained interest of the research community in recent years, due to its importance in continuous and non-invasive monitoring of BP for early detection of hypertension, thereby reducing mortality. Several approaches that involve photoplethysmography (PPG) and Pulse Transit Time (PTT) have been explored with promising results; however the requirement of two sensors makes them obtrusive for continuous use. Single PPG sensor approaches using machine learning have also been attempted, but there are certain deficiencies in these methods as they go for a one-size-fits-all approach. In this work, we develop an ensemble of BP prediction models based on demographic and physiological partitioning. Also, we incorporate a set of unique PPG features into our models, which results in test accuracies of 5 mmHg Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Diastolic BP, and 6.9 mmHg MAE for Systolic BP. Given our marked improvement over ubiquitous models (18{\%} for Diastolic BP and 11.5{\%} for Systolic BP), this approach opens up avenues where single PPG sensor based methods can predict BP with a high degree of accuracy. This is a big step towards developing continuous BP monitoring systems, and can help in better management of cardiac health.},

abstract = {Introduction. Blood pressure (BP) has been a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. BP measurement is one of the most useful parameters for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. At present, BP measurement mainly relies on cuff-based techniques that cause inconvenience and discomfort to users. Although some of the present prototype cuffless BP measurement techniques are able to reach overall acceptable accuracies, they require an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a photoplethysmograph (PPG) that make them unsuitable for true wearable applications. Therefore, developing a single PPG-based cuffless BP estimation algorithm with enough accuracy would be clinically and practically useful. Methods. The University of Queensland vital sign dataset (online database) was accessed to extract raw PPG signals and its corresponding reference BPs (systolic BP and diastolic BP). The online database consisted of PPG waveforms of 32 cases from whom 8133 (good quality) signal segments (5 s for each) were extracted, preprocessed, and normalised in both width and amplitude. Three most significant pulse features (pulse area, pulse rising time, and width 25{\%}) with their corresponding reference BPs were used to train and test three machine learning algorithms (regression tree, multiple linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM)). A 10-fold cross-validation was applied to obtain overall BP estimation accuracy, separately for the three machine learning algorithms. Their estimation accuracies were further analysed separately for three clinical BP categories (normotensive, hypertensive, and hypotensive). Finally, they were compared with the ISO standard for noninvasive BP device validation (average difference no greater than 5 mmHg and SD no greater than 8 mmHg). Results. In terms of overall estimation accuracy, the regression tree achieved the best overall accuracy for SBP (mean and SD of difference:-0.1 ± 6.5 mmHg) and DBP (mean and SD of difference:-0.6 ± 5.2 mmHg). MLR and SVM achieved the overall mean difference less than 5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP, but their SD of difference was {\textgreater}8 mmHg. Regarding the estimation accuracy in each BP categories, only the regression tree achieved acceptable ISO standard for SBP (-1.1 ± 5.7 mmHg) and DBP (-0.03 ± 5.6 mmHg) in the normotensive category. MLR and SVM did not achieve acceptable accuracies in any BP categories. Conclusion. This study developed and compared three machine learning algorithms to estimate BPs using PPG only and revealed that the regression tree algorithm was the best approach with overall acceptable accuracy to ISO standard for BP device validation. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the regression tree algorithm achieved acceptable measurement accuracy only in the normotensive category, suggesting that future algorithm development for BP estimation should be more specific for different BP categories.},

abstract = {Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.},

Current methods of continuous measurement of blood pressure are either invasive and/or require expensive equipment. Therefore, we investigated a new method for the continuous estimation of two main features of blood pressure waveform: systolic and diastolic pressures. The estimates were obtained from a photoplethysmography signal as input to the fifth order autoregressive moving average models. The performance of the method was evaluated using beat-to-beat full-wave blood pressure measurements from 15 young subjects, with no known cardiovascular disorder, in supine position as they breathed normally and also while they performed a breath-hold maneuver. The level of error in the estimates, as measured by the root mean square of the model residuals, was less than 5 mmHg during normal breathing and less than 8 mmHg during the breath-hold maneuver. The mean of model residuals both during normal breathing and breath-hold maneuvers was considered to be less than 3.2 mmHg. The dependency of the accuracy of the estimates on the subject data was assessed by comparing the modeling errors for the 15 subjects. Less than 1{\%} of the models showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) from the other models, which indicates a high level of consistency among the models.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have become the biggest threat to human health, and they are accelerated by hypertension. The best way to avoid the many complications of CVDs is to manage and prevent hypertension at an early stage. However, there are no symptoms at all for most types of hypertension, especially for prehypertension. The awareness and control rates of hypertension are extremely low. In this study, a novel hypertension management method based on arterial wave propagation theory and photoplethysmography (PPG) morphological theory was researched to explore the physiological changes in different blood pressure (BP) levels. Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) features were extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG signals to represent the arterial wave propagation theory and PPG morphological theory, respectively. Three feature sets, one containing PAT only, one containing PPG features only, and one containing both PAT and PPG features, were used to classify the different BP categories, defined as normotension, prehypertension, and hypertension. PPG features were shown to classify BP categories more accurately than PAT. Furthermore, PAT and PPG combined features improved the BP classification performance. The F1 scores to classify normotension versus prehypertension reached 84.34{\%}, the scores for normotension versus hypertension reached 94.84{\%}, and the scores for normotension plus prehypertension versus hypertension reached 88.49{\%}. This indicates that the simultaneous collection of ECG and PPG signals could detect hypertension.},

abstract = {Existing methods for arterial blood pressure (BP) estimation directly map the input physiological signals to output BP values without explicitly modeling the underlying temporal dependencies in BP dynamics. As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating BP estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep RNN model was tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional BP prediction models. On a multi-day BP dataset, the deep RNN achieved RMSE of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 mmHg for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day SBP prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 mmHg for corresponding DBP prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement. The experimental results suggest that modeling the temporal dependencies in BP dynamics significantly improves the long-term BP prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation using pulse transit time (PTT) is a promising method for unobtrusive BP measurement. However, the accuracy of this approach must be improved for it to be viable for a wide range of applications. This study proposes a novel continuous BP estimation approach that combines data mining techniques with a traditional mechanism-driven model. First, 14 features derived from simultaneous electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram signals were extracted for beat-to-beat BP estimation. A genetic algorithm-based feature selection method was then used to select BP indicators for each subject. Multivariate linear regression and support vector regression were employed to develop the BP model. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach were validated for static, dynamic, and follow-up performance. Experimental results based on 73 subjects showed that the proposed approach exhibited excellent accuracy in static BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient and mean error of 0.852 and -0.001 ± 3.102 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.790 and -0.004 ± 2.199 mmHg for diastolic BP. Similar performance was observed for dynamic BP estimation. The robustness results indicated that the estimation accuracy was lower by a certain degree one day after model construction but was relatively stable from one day to six months after construction. The proposed approach is superior to the state-of-the-art PTT-based model for an approximately 2-mmHg reduction in the standard derivation at different time intervals, thus providing potentially novel insights for cuffless BP estimation.},

Recent studies emphasise the potential information embedded in the PPG waveform signal and it deserves further attention for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation.

abstract = {24-h blood pressure (BP) has significant prognostic value for cardiovascular risk screening, but the present BP devices are mainly cuff-based, which are unsuitable for long-term BP measurement, especially during nighttime. In this paper, we developed an armband wearable pulse transit time (PTT) system for 24-h cuff-less BP measurement and evaluated it in an unattended out-of-laboratory setting. Ten healthy young subjects participated in this ambulatory study, where PTT was measured at 30-min interval by this wearable system and the reference BP was measured by a standard oscillometric ambulatory BP monitor. Due to the misalignment of BP and PTT on their recording time caused by the different measurement principles of the two BP devices, a new estimation method has been proposed: transients in PTT were removed from the raw data by defined criteria, and then evenly interpolated, low-pass filtered, and resampled to synchronize at the time when BP was recorded. The results show that with the proposed method, the correlation between PTT and systolic BP (SBP) during nighttime with dynamic range of 21.8 ± 14.2 mmHg has improved from -0.50 ± 0.24 to -0.62 ± 0.20 (p{\textless}0.1) , and the difference between the estimated and reference SBP has improved from 0.7 ± 10.7 to 2.8 ± 8.2 mmHg with root mean square error reduced from 10.7 to 8.7 mmHg. In addition, the correlation between a very low frequency component of SBP and PTT obtained from the proposed method during nighttime is -0.80 ± 0.10 and the difference is 2.4 ± 5.7 mmHg for a dynamic BP range of 13.5 ± 8.0 mmHg. It is therefore concluded from this study that the proposed wearable system has great potential to be used for overnight SBP monitoring, especially to measure the averaged SBP over a long period. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The velocity of the propagating arterial pulse wave (pulse wave velocity, PWV) has been proposed as an unobtrusive and possibly continuous surrogate measure of systolic blood pressure (SBP). PWV is derived from the arrival time of the blood pulse at a peripheral arterial location, most often the finger. Reported performances were not yet accurate enough for clinical application but good enough as an unobtrusive surrogate in other settings. However, the finger PPG is not an ideal location in the home setting as it obstructs hand movement and can suffer from peripheral vasomotion and orthostatic pressure changes. In this paper we examine the viability of other pulse arrival locations for the measurement of PWV. PWV was derived to the finger (most common location), wrist (less obtrusive location), ear (more proximal) and ankle (more distal). Correlation analysis for PWV from each location with SBP was performed and the calibration procedure was studied. Wrist PWV accuracy is found to be comparable to finger PWV in terms of correlation and estimation error with SBP. The ear PWV, being a theoretically favorable location, is shown to have a larger inter-subject variance in the calibration procedure compared to other locations. Ankle PWV shows stable calibration parameters across subjects but Bland-Altmann analysis reveals unusual error trends. In conclusion, while results indicate that all sensor locations are usable to some extent, there are still some distinct properties associated with each sensor location that should be taken into account when designing an SBP algorithm based on PWV.},

abstract = {Objective. Evaluate a method for the estimation of the nocturnal systolic blood pressure (SBP) dip from 24 h blood pressure trends using a wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and a deep neural network in free-living individuals, comparing the deep neural network to traditional machine learning and non-machine learning baselines. Approach. A wrist-worn PPG sensor was worn by 106 healthy individuals for 226 d during which 5111 reference values for blood pressure (BP) were obtained with a 24 h ambulatory BP monitor and matched with the PPG sensor data. Features based on heart rate variability and pulse morphology were extracted from the PPG waveforms. Long- and short term memory (LSTM) networks, dense networks, random forests and linear regression models were trained and evaluated in their capability of tracking trends in BP, as well as the estimation of the SBP dip. Main results. Best performance for estimating the SBP dip were obtained with a deep LSTM neural network with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.12 2.20 mmHg and a correlation of 0.69 . This dip was derived from trend estimates of BP which had an RMSE of 8.22 1.49 mmHg for systolic and 6.55 1.39 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). While other models had similar performance for the tracking of relative BP, they did not perform as well as the LSTM for the SBP dip. Significance: The work provides first evidence for the unobtrusive estimation of the nocturnal SBP dip, a highly prognostic clinical parameter. It is also the first to evaluate unobtrusive BP measurement in a large data set of unconstrained 24 h measurements in free-living individuals and provides evidence for the utility of LSTM models in this domain.},

The vital-sign distributions from "normal" patients were found to vary over time from admission to the post-operative ward to their discharge home, but no significant changes in their distributions were observed from halfway through their stay on the ward to the time of discharge. The model of normality identified patient deterioration when tested with unseen "abnormal" data, suggesting that such techniques may be used to provide early warning of adverse physiological events. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The intensive care unit (ICU) admits the most severely ill patients, and the goal of the unit can be interpreted as stabilizing patient physiology. Once these patients are discharged from the ICU to a step-down ward, they continue to have their vital signs monitored by nursing staff. Early detection of physiological deterioration has been highlighted as a key step to reduce ICU readmission and improve patient outcomes. Vital signs were collected for a dataset of 98 patients admitted to an ICU and who survived to hospital discharge after their stay on a step-down ward. A model of physiological normality was developed using data from the day of hospital discharge, and patients were retrospectively evaluated throughout their stay using this model. We show that the physiology of patients being cared for in the ICU improves very rapidly in the three days prior to discharge, and furthermore, that this recovery continues during their stay on the ward, albeit at a slower rate.},

abstract = {Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmography (PPG) are both useful techniques to monitor cardiovascular status. Though ABP monitoring is more widely employed, this procedure of signal acquisition whether done invasively or non-invasively may cause inconvenience and discomfort to the patients. PPG, however, is simple, noninvasive, and can be used for continuous measurement. This paper focuses on analyzing the similarities in time and frequency domains between ABP and PPG signals for normotensive, prehypertensive and hypertensive subjects and the feasibility of the classification of subjects considering the results of the analysis performed. From a database with 120 records of ABP and PPG, each 120 s in length, the records where separated into epochs taking into account 10 heartbeats, and the following statistical measures were performed: Correlation (r), Coherence (COH), Partial Coherence (pCOH), Partial Directed Coherence (PDC), Directed Transfer Function (DTF), Full Frequency Directed Transfer Function (ffDTF) and Direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF). The correlation coefficient was r {\textgreater} 0.9 on average for all groups, indicating a strong morphology similarity. For COH and pCOH, coherence (linear correlation in frequency domain) was found with significance (p {\textless} 0.01) in differentiating between normotensive and hypertensive subjects using PPG signals. For the dataset at hand, only two synchrony measures are able to convincingly distinguish hypertensive subjects from normotensive control subjects, i.e., ffDTF and dDTF. From PDC, DTF, ffDTF, and dDTF, a consistent, a strong significant causality from ABP→PPG was found. When all synchrony measures were combined, an 87.5 {\%} accuracy was achieved to detect hypertension using a Neural Network classifier, suggesting that PPG holds most informative features that exist in ABP.},

abstract = {We investigated the system identification approach for potentially improved estimation of pulse transit time (PTT), a popular arterial stiffness marker. In this approach, proximal and distal arterial waveforms are measured and respectively regarded as the input and output of a system. Next, the system impulse response is identified from all samples of the measured input and output. Finally, the time delay of the impulse response is detected as the PTT estimate. Unlike conventional foot-to-foot detection techniques, this approach is designed to provide an artifact robust estimate of the true PTT in the absence of wave reflection. The approach is also applicable to arbitrary types of arterial waveforms. We specifically applied a parametric system identification technique to noninvasive impedance cardiography (ICG) and peripheral arterial blood pressure waveforms from 15 humans subjected to lower-body negative pressure. We assessed the technique through the correlation coefficient (r) between its 1/PTT estimates and measured diastolic pressure (DP) per subject and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the DP predicted from these estimates and measured DP. The technique achieved average r and RMSE values of 0.81 ± 0.16 and 4.3 ± 1.3 mmHg. For comparison, the corresponding values were 0.59 ± 0.37 (P {\textless} 0.05) and 5.9 ± 2.5 (P {\textless} 0.01) mmHg for the conventional technique applied to the same waveforms and 0.28 ± 0.40 (P {\textless} 0.001) and 7.2 ± 1.8 (P {\textless} 0.001) mmHg for the conventional technique with the ECG waveform substituted for the ICG waveform. These results demonstrate, perhaps for the first time, that the system identification approach can indeed improve PTT estimation. {\textcopyright} 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Measurement of arterial stiffness is assuming an increasing role in the clinical assessment of patients. Indeed, arterial stiffness and wave reflections are now well accepted as the most important determinants of increasing systolic and pulse pressure in our aging community, and thus as the cause of cardiovascular (CV) complications and events, including stroke and myocardial infarction. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is a direct measure of arterial stiffness, is the gold standard, since it requires little technical expertise and is supported by the greatest amount of epidemiological evidence. Indeed, aortic stiffness has independent predictive value for all-cause and CV mortality, CV disease, fatal and nonfatal coronary events and fatal strokes in patients with various levels of CV risk. Carotid pulse pressure and augmentation index are only indirect, surrogate measures of arterial stiffness. However, they provide additional information concerning wave reflections. They have demonstrated their predictive value in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Carotid stiffness was predictive of CV events in a small number of patients with ESRD or following renal transplantation, but had no independent predictive value in a larger number of patients with manifest arterial disease or in the healthy elderly patients of the Rotterdam study. To be not only an intermediate end point but also a surrogate end point, aortic stiffness has to demonstrate that its attenuation has an effect on CV mortality, coronary events and stroke. This remains to be established in populations at low to medium CV risk - i.e., with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and moderate chronic kidney disease. {\textcopyright} Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Nefrologia.},

abstract = {Background: Current guidelines for the management of hypertension rest almost completely on the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, the arterial blood pressure wave is more correctly described as consisting of a pulsatile (pulse pressure) and a steady (mean pressure) component. Objective: To explore the independent roles of pulse pressure and mean pressure as determinants of cardiovascular prognosis in older hypertensive patients. Methods: This meta-analysis, based on individual patient data, pooled the results of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial (n = 840), the Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial (n = 4695), and the Systolic Hypertension in China Trial (n = 2394). The relative hazard rates associated with pulse pressure and mean pressure were calculated using Cox regression analysis, with stratification for the 3 trials and with adjustments for sex, age, previous cardiovascular complications, smoking, and treatment group. Results: A 10-mm Hg wider pulse pressure increased the risk of major cardiovascular complications; after controlling for mean pressure and the other covariates, the increase in risk ranged from approximately 13{\%} for all coronary end points (P = .02) to nearly 20{\%} for cardiovascular mortality (P = .001). In a similar analysis, mean pressure predicted the incidence of cardiovascular complications but only after removal of pulse pressure as an explanatory variable from the model. Furthermore, the probability of a major cardiovascular end point increased with higher systolic blood pressure; at any given level of systolic blood pressure, it also increased with lower diastolic blood pressure, suggesting that the wider pulse pressure was driving the risk of major complications. Conclusions: In older hypertensive patients, pulse pressure not mean pressure is the major determinant of cardiovascular risk. The implications of these findings for the management of hypertensive patients should be further investigated in randomized controlled outcome trials in which the pulsatile component of blood pressure is differently affected by antihypertensive drug treatment.},

abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) is a pivotal marker of vascular stiffness. Because the actual PTT duration in vivo is unknown and the complicated variation in waveform may occur, the robust determination of characteristic point is still a very difficult task in the PTT estimation. Our objective is to devise a method for real-time estimation of PTT duration in pulse wave. It has an ability to reduce the interference caused by both high- and low-frequency noise. The reproducibility and performance of these methods are assessed on both artificial and clinical pulse data. Artificial data are generated to investigate the reproducibility with various signal-to-noise ratios. For all artificial data, the mean biases obtained from all methods are less than 1 ms; collectively, this newly proposed method has minimum standard deviation (SD, {\textless}1 ms). A set of data from 33 participants together with the synchronously recorded continuous blood pressure data are used to investigate the correlation coefficient (CC). The statistical analysis shows that our method has maximum values of mean CC (0.5231), sum of CCs (17.26), and median CC (0.5695) and has the minimum SD of CCs (0.1943). Overall, the test results in this study indicate that the newly developed method has advantages over traditional decision rules for the PTT measurement.},

abstract = {Background: Blood pressure (BP) measurements have been used widely in clinical and private environments. Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation.},

Increased arterial stiffness is an important determinant of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Objective: To assess whether Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) predicts the occurrence of stroke in hypertensive patients. Methods: A cohort, observational and prospective study, including 1133 hypertensive patients (586 men), with a mean age 51.05 ± 12.64 years, was designed. PWV with the Complior method was performed in all patients, as well as a detailed clinical evaluation and blood pressure measurement. Results: The cumulative incidence of stroke in hypertensive patients with increased PWV was 3.25{\%} (CI: 1.97{\%} -5.25{\%}), compared with 0.78{\%} (CI: 0.28{\%} -1.87{\%}) in hypertensive patients with normal PWV (Risk Ratio (RR) = 4.15; CI:1.53-11.26). In a multivariate analysis, adjusting the model to classical cardiovascular risk factors, PWV was an independent predictor of stroke, with a Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.40 (CI:1.13-1.73, p{\textless}0.001), indicating a 40{\%} increase in the risk of stroke per 1m/s increment in PWV. The addition of PWV to a model consisting of conventional cardiovascular risk factors significantly improved the discriminative capacity for stroke (Harrell's C increased from 0.68 to 0.71 after the inclusion of the PWV; p{\textless}0.01).

Adaptive thresholds are applied to the length signal to determine the onset and duration of the QRS complex. The algorithm was evaluated with the complete set of single channel ECGs (signal 0) from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, and achieved a gross QRS sensitivity of 99.65{\%} and a gross QRS positive predictive accuracy of 99.77{\%}. The QRS onset determination is very stable and is insensitive to QRS morphology change. The noise tolerance of the algorithm was evaluated using the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database.

abstract = {Stages of different depth characterize the temporal organization of sleep. Each stage exerts an effect on blood pressure (BP) regulation and contributes to its 24-h variation. The main determinant of the circadian influences of sleep and wakefulness on BP is the daytime sympathetic and nighttime parasympathetic prevalence, but many other physiologic mechanisms known either to induce sleep or determine arousal may play an important role in the mediation of sleep influences on BP. Alteration of one or more of such mechanisms may be reflected in altered circadian BP rhythms. Sleep- and arousal-related mechanisms and phenomena that affect circadian BP rhythms include neurohumoral sleep factors (arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, somatotropin, insulin, steroid hormones and metabolites, and serotonin among others) and waking factors (corticotropin-releasing factor, adrenocorticotropin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, endogenous opioids, and prostaglandin (E2)). Pathologic respiratory variations (sleep-disordered breathing) and insomnia are major causes of the sleep-related alteration of the circadian BP profile, including loss of the expected normal decline in BP by 10-20{\%} from the daytime level. A great number of medical disorders can cause insomnia, but objective sleep studies have been performed only in a minority of them. Overall, the sleep-related pathophysiological mechanisms actually involved in causing altered circadian BP rhythms in different normotensive and hypertensive conditions are not completely understood. In any case, changes in the circadian BP rhythm are known to be strongly related to one's risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, thus representing strong prognostic indicators worthy of further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to assess the prognostic value of blood pressure variability within 24 hours. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library to April 2013, we conducted a systematic review of prospective studies of adults, with at least one year follow-up and any day, night or 24-hour blood pressure variability measure as a predictor of one or more of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular events, stroke and coronary heart disease. We examined how blood pressure variability is defined and how its prognostic use is reported. We analysed relative risks adjusted for covariates including the appropriate mean blood pressure and considered the potential for meta-analysis. Our analysis of methods included 24 studies and analysis of predictions included 16 studies. There were 36 different measures of blood pressure variability and 13 definitions of night- and day-time periods. Median follow-up was 5.5 years (interquartile range 4.2-7.0). Comparing measures of dispersion, coefficient of variation was less well researched than standard deviation. Night dipping based on percentage change was the most researched measure and the only measure for which data could be meaningfully pooled. Night dipping or lower night-time blood pressure was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events. The interpretation and use in clinical practice of 24-hour blood pressure variability, as an important prognostic indicator of cardiovascular events, is hampered by insufficient evidence and divergent methodologies. We recommend greater standardisation of methods.},

In this first part of this paper, the general principles of circadian biology that underlie clinical evaluation and treatment are reviewed. We then report on the accumulated evidence regarding the evaluation and treatment of shift work disorder (SWD) and jet lag disorder (JLD). Methods: A set of specific questions relevant to clinical practice were formulated, a systematic literature search was performed, and relevant articles were abstracted and graded. Results: A substantial body of literature has accumulated that provides a rational basis the evaluation and treatment of SWD and JLD. Physiological assessment has involved determination of circadian phase using core body temperature and the timing of melatonin secretion. Behavioral assessment has involved sleep logs, actigraphy and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Treatment interventions fall into three broad categories: 1) prescribed sleep scheduling, 2) circadian phase shifting ("resetting the clock"), and 3) symptomatic treatment using hypnotic and stimulant medications. Conclusion: Circadian rhythm science has also pointed the way to rational interventions for the SWD and JLD, and these treatments have been introduced into the practice of sleep medicine with varying degrees of success. More translational research is needed, using subjects who meet current diagnostic criteria.},

abstract = {Obesity has reached crisis proportions in industrialized societies [1]. Many factors converge to yield increased body mass index (BMI). Among these is sleep duration [2-10]. The circadian clock controls sleep timing through the process of entrainment. Chronotype describes individual differences in sleep timing, and it is determined by genetic background, age, sex, and environment (e.g., light exposure) [11-14]. Social jetlag quantifies the discrepancy that often arises between circadian and social clocks, which results in chronic sleep loss [11, 15]. The circadian clock also regulates energy homeostasis [16], and its disruption - as with social jetlag - may contribute to weight-related pathologies [17-19]. Here, we report the results from a large-scale epidemiological study, showing that, beyond sleep duration, social jetlag is associated with increased BMI. Our results demonstrate that living "against the clock" may be a factor contributing to the epidemic of obesity.

abstract = {Circadian clocks are intracellular molecular mechanisms designed to allow the cell, organ, and organism to prepare for an anticipated stimulus prior to its onset. In order for circadian clocks to maintain their selective advantage, they must be entrained to the environment. Light, sound, temperature, physical activity (including sleep/wake transitions), and food intake are among the strongest environmental factors influencing mammalian circadian clocks. Normal circadian rhythmicities in these environmental factors have become severely disrupted in our modern day society, concomitant with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Here, we review our current knowledge regarding the roles of peripheral circadian clocks, concentrating on those found within tissues directly involved in metabolic homeostasis and cardiovascular function. We propose that both inter- and intra-organ dyssynchronization, through alteration/impairment of peripheral circadian clocks, accelerates the development of cardiovascular disease risk factors associated with cardiometabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Mammals synchronize their circadian activity primarily to the cycles of light and darkness in the environment. This is achieved by ocular photoreception relaying signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. Signals from the SCN cause the synchronization of independent circadian clocks throughout the body to appropriate phases. Signals that can entrain these peripheral clocks include humoral signals, metabolic factors, and body temperature. At the level of individual tissues, thousands of genes are brought to unique phases through the actions of a local transcription/translation-based feedback oscillator and systemic cues. In this molecular clock, the proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 cause the transcription of genes which ultimately feedback and inhibit CLOCK and BMAL1 transcriptional activity. Finally, there are also other molecular circadian oscillators which can act independently of the transcription-based clock in all species which have been tested. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) varies according to cycles characterized by a reduction during sleep and an increase on awakening. The nighttime decrease is absent or blunted in some patients (termed "non-dippers"). Cross-sectional and prospective data have shown that non-dippers have more target organ damage than have dippers in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. We reviewed the English language literature regarding this association. A non-fortuitous association seems to exist between non-dipper status and cardiovascular risk such as stroke and cardiac events. Among diabetic patients, this phenomenon has been described to occur more often in individuals with autonomic neuropathy and with different degrees of diabetic nephropathy. In normoalbuminuric normotensive type I diabetic patients without any degree of autonomic dysfunction, according to traditional cardiovascular tests, diastolic BP (dBP) night / day ratio is associated with an increased glomerular filtration rate and an increased extracellular volume. The disruption of the circadian rhythm of sympathovagal activity in non-dipper patients was associated with higher levels in systolic BP (sBP) and dBP and with a reduced decline in sBP and dBP levels during the night. Therefore, the prognostic implications of the non-dipper status may be important since the overall 24-h blood pressure load is elevated in these individuals. These data suggest that patients in whom blood pressure decreases during the night incur less damage to their brain, kidneys, heart, and blood vessels than people with elevated nocturnal BP. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Objective. A novel algorithm to detect the dicrotic notch in arterial pressure signals is proposed. Its performance is evaluated using both aortic and radial artery pressure signals, and its robustness to variations in design parameters is investigated. Methods. Most previously published dicrotic notch detection algorithms scan the arterial pressure waveform for the characteristic pressure change that is associated with the dicrotic notch. Aortic valves, however, are closed by the backwards motion of aortic blood volume. We developed an algorithm that uses arterial flow to detect the dicrotic notch in arterial pressure waveforms. Arterial flow is calculated, from arterial pressure using simulation results with a three-element windkessel model. Aortic valve closure is detected after the systolic upstroke and at the minimum of the first negative dip in the calculated flow signal. Results. In 7 dogs ejection times were derived from a calculated aortic flow signal and from simultaneously measured aortic flow probe data. A total of 86 beats was analyzed; the difference in ejection times was -0.6 ± 5.4 ms (mean ± SD). The algorithm was further evaluated using 6 second epochs of radial artery pressure data measured in 50 patients. Model simulations were carried out using both a linear windkessel model and a pressure and age dependent nonlinear windkessel model. Visual inspection by an experienced clinician confirmed that the algorithm correctly identified the dicrotic notch in 98{\%} (49 of 50) of the patients rising the linear model, and 96{\%}; (48 of 50)of the patients using the nonlinear model. The position of the dicrotic notch appeared to be less sensitive to variations in algorithm's design parameters when a nonlinear windkessel model was used. Conclusions. The detection of the dicrotic notch in arterial pressure signals is facilitated by first calculating the arterial flow wave form from arterial pressure arid a model of arterial afterload. The method is robust and reduces the problem of detecting a dubious point in a decreasing pressure signal to the detection of a well-defined minimum in a derived signal.},

Least-squares regression was used to estimate BP in the first test and a repeatability test carried out half year later. BP in the repeatability test was also estimated using the regression coefficients in the first test. The results illustrated that in the first and repeatability tests (1) arterial BP increased and PTT decreased acutely after the exercises and (2) systolic BP was highly correlated with PTT. In the repeatability test, the estimation differences from the references were 0.0 ± 5.3 mmHg and 0.0 ± 2.9 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BPs respectively using least-squares regression. However, the estimation differences increased to 1.4 ± 10.2 mmHg and 2.1 ± 7.3 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BPs, respectively when the regression coefficients in the first test were used for prediction.

abstract = {A continuous noninvasive method of systolic blood pressure estimation is described. Systolic blood pressure is estimated by combining two separately obtained components: a higher frequency component obtained by extracting a specific frequency band of pulse arrival time and a lower frequency component obtained from the intermittently acquired systolic blood pressure measurements with an auscultatory or oscillometric system. The pulse arrival time was determined by the time interval from QRS apex in electrocardiogram to the onset of photoplethysmogram in a fingertip beat-by-beat via an oximetric sensor. The method was examined in 20 patients during cardiovascular surgery. The estimated values of systolic blood pressure were compared with those measured invasively using a radial arterial catheter. The results showed that the correlation coefficients between estimated values and invasively obtained systolic blood pressure reached 0.97±0.02 (mean±SD), and the error remained within ±10{\%} in 97.8{\%} of the monitoring period. By using a system with automatic cuff inflation and deflation to acquire intermittent systolic blood pressure values, this method can be applicable for the continuous noninvasive monitoring of systolic blood pressure.},

abstract = {The relationship between pulse‐arrival times and diastolic blood pressure was measured in 10 anesthetized dogs. The pulse‐arrival time was measured using the R‐wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a time reference. Pulse‐transit time was also measured between the carotid and femoral pulses. Blood pressure was raised with epinephrine injected intravenously and lowered with vagal stimulation. In all cases, pulse arrival and transit times decreased with an increase in diastolic pressure for diastolic pressures ranging from 15 to 250 mmHg. The correlation between pulse‐arrival time and pressure was poorest when the ECG was used as a timing reference. The best correlation was found with true pulse‐transit time and diastolic pressure. When pulse‐transit time was used to compute pulse‐wave velocity, it was found to increase nearly linearly with blood pressure. From 90–100 mmHg, the pulse‐wave velocity increased typically by slightly less than six percent. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {In this work, we describe a beat-by-beat method for assessing the clinical utility of pulsatile waveforms, primarily recorded from cardiovascular blood volume or pressure changes, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Physiological blood flow is nonstationary, with pulses changing in height, width and morphology due to changes in heart rate, cardiac output, sensor type and hardware or software pre-processing requirements. Moreover, considerable inter-individual and sensor-location variability exists. Simple template matching methods are therefore inappropriate, and a patient-specific adaptive initialization is therefore required. We introduce dynamic time warping to stretch each beat to match a running template and combine it with several other features related to signal quality, including correlation and the percentage of the beat that appeared to be clipped. The features were then presented to a multi-layer perceptron neural network to learn the relationships between the parameters in the presence of good- and bad-quality pulses. An expert-labeled database of 1055 segments of PPG, each 6s long, recorded from 104 separate critical care admissions during both normal and verified arrhythmic events, was used to train and test our algorithms. An accuracy of 97.5{\%} on the training set and 95.2{\%} on test set was found. The algorithm could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the clinical utility of PPG traces or any similar quasi-periodic signal. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

The detection, measurement, and management of high blood pressure play an essential role in the prevention and control of CVDs. However, owing to the limitations and discomfort of traditional blood pressure (BP) detection techniques, many new cuff-less blood pressure approaches have been proposed and explored. Most of these involve arterial wave propagation theory, which is based on pulse arrival time (PAT), the time interval needed for a pulse wave to travel from the heart to some distal place on the body, such as the finger or earlobe. For this study, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database was used as a benchmark for PAT analysis. Many researchers who use the MIMIC database make the erroneous assumption that all the signals are synchronized. Therefore, we decided to investigate the calculation of PAT intervals in the MIMIC database and check its usefulness for evaluating BP. Our findings have important implications for the future use of the MIMIC database, especially for BP evaluation.},

abstract = {Presently available procedures for measuring blood pressure are not completely satisfactory for Es wishing to investigate the operant conditioning of cardiovascular activity. A system is described for measuring a correlate of the blood pressure information obtained with conventional sphygmomanometric systems. The procedure involves the measurement of speed of propagation through the arterial system of the pressure pulse from the heart's contraction. This speed, the pulse wave velocity, is closely related to cuff-derived blood pressure. Many of the problems present with current sphygmomanometric systems are absent with this apparatus and procedure. The apparatus can be assembled from common instruments or constructed from integrated circuits. Data collected with the apparatus confirm earlier studies which indicate that pulse wave velocity is correlated with sphygmomanometrically measured blood pressure and is a valuable cardiovascular response measure. {\textcopyright} 1974 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a surrogate of arterial stiffness and represents a non-invasive marker of cardiovascular risk. The non-invasive measurement of PWV requires tracking the arrival time of pressure pulses recorded in vivo, commonly referred to as pulse arrival time (PAT). In the state of the art, PAT is estimated by identifying a characteristic point of the pressure pulse waveform. This paper demonstrates that for ambulatory scenarios, where signal-to-noise ratios are below 10 dB, the performance in terms of repeatability of PAT measurements through characteristic points identification degrades drastically. Hence, we introduce a novel family of PAT estimators based on the parametric modeling of the anacrotic phase of a pressure pulse. In particular, we propose a parametric PAT estimator (TANH) that depicts high correlation with the Complior characteristic point D1 (CC = 0.99), increases noise robustness and reduces by a five-fold factor the number of heartbeats required to obtain reliable PAT measurements. {\textcopyright} 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract = {Careful determination of pulse wave velocity is important in the study of arterial viscoelastic properties, wave reflections, and ventricular-arterial interactions. In spite of its increasingly widespread use, there is as yet no standardized method for its determination. Most studies have manually identified the transit time of the pressure wave front as it travels over a known distance in the arterial system, but the issues of accuracy and reproducibility have not been addressed. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of four computerized algorithms in the determination of pulse wave velocities in invasive as well as in noninvasive pressure determinations. The four methods were the identification of: (1) the point of minimum diastolic pressure, (2) the point at which the first derivative of pressure is maximum, (3) the point at which the second derivative of pressure is maximum, and (4) the point yielded by the intersection of a line tangent to the initial systolic upstroke of the pressure tracing and a horizontal line through the minimum point. High-fidelity aortic pressure recordings were obtained in 26 patients with a multi-sensor micromanometer catheter. Noninvasive brachial and radial pressure waveforms were recorded in 11 volunteers with external piezoelectric transducers. The results show that the first derivative method consistently provided results that were different from the other methods for both the invasive and noninvasive methods because of changes in the structure of the upstroke as the arterial pulse propagates distally. Although the minimum method worked well for the invasive determinations, it was erratic with the noninvasive determinations, probably because of the higher amount of noise and reflection in the latter. Among the four algorithms, the second derivative and the intersecting tangents methods worked well with both invasive and noninvasive determinations with mean variation coefficients of less than 7{\%} and correlation coefficients between the methods of greater than 0.90 for all data. In conclusion, computerized algorithms allow accurate determination of pulse wave velocity in invasively and noninvasively measured arterial pressure waveforms. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Pulse transit time (PTT) has been widely used for noninvasive examination of the arterial viscoelastic properties, such as elasticity, compliance, and stiffness of the vessel walls. PTT is usually determined as the time interval between the peak of the electrocardiogram R wave and the foot of the photoplethysmogram (PPG). However, it was observed that the PPG is affected by the applied contact force between the photoplethysmographic sensor and the measurement site, e.g., finger. In this study, the nonlinear biomechanical properties of the finger arterial wall were considered when investigating the changes in PTT with varying contact force. Emphasis was placed on the changes in the shape of the arterial wall pressure-volume curve. The simulation results indicated that at positive transmural pressure, PTT increased with the applied contact force, reaching the maximum at zero transmural pressure and remaining at a constant level at negative transmural pressure. The theoretical analysis was further verified by the experiments carried out on thirty young subjects and six elderly subjects using twelve discrete levels of contact force. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Blood pressure pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a parameter which is related to arterial distensibility. Its direct assessment, by measuring the appearance time of a pressure pulse in two sites along an artery and the distance between the two sites, is complicated and inaccurate. In the current study, pulse transit time (PTT) to the toes and fingers of 44 normotensive male subjects was measured by photoplethysmography (PPG) and ECG. The arrival time of the pulses at the toe and finger was determined from the foot of the systolic rise of the PPG signal, i.e. at end-diastolic time. Two parameters, which are related to PWV, were tested: the time delay between the ECG R-wave and the arrival time of the pulses at the toe (E-T PTT), and the difference in the transit time of the blood pressure pulses between the toe and finger (T-F PTTD). E-T PTT and T-F PTTD decreased as functions of the subject's age and systolic blood pressure (SBP), but their dependence on the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not statistically significant. The decrease of the PTT parameters with age is attributed to the direct structural decrease of the arterial compliance with age and not to functional effects associated with the increase of the blood pressure with age, since the PTT parameters did not depend on DBP though the measurements were performed at end-diastole.},

abstract = {Pressure measured with a cuff and sphygmomanometer in the brachial artery is accepted as an important predictor of future cardiovascular risk. However, systolic pressure varies throughout the arterial tree, such that aortic (central) systolic pressure is actually lower than corresponding brachial values, although this difference is highly variable between individuals. Emerging evidence now suggests that central pressure is better related to future cardiovascular events than is brachia pressure. Moreover, anti-Hypertensive drugs can exert differential effects on brachial and central pressure. Therefore, basing treatment decisions on central, rather than brachial pressure, is likely to have important implications for the future diagnosis and management of hypertension. Such a paradigm shift will, however, require further, direct evidence that selectively targeting central pressure, brings added benefit, over and above that already provided by brachial artery pressure. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.},

abstract = {Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension. The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Blood pressure (BP) is highest during the day and lowest at night. Absence of this rhythm is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Contributions of changes in posture and physical activity to the 24-hour day/night rhythm in BP are not well understood. We hypothesized that postural changes and physical activity contribute substantially to the day/night rhythm in BP.METHODS Fourteen healthy, sedentary, nonobese, normotensive men (aged 19-50 years) each completed an ambulatory and a bed rest condition during which BP was measured every 30-60 minutes for 24 hours. When ambulatory, subjects followed their usual routines without restrictions to capture the "normal" condition. During bed rest, subjects were constantly confined to bed in a 6-degree head-down position; therefore posture was constant, and physical activity was minimized. Two subjects were excluded from analysis because of irregular sleep timing.RESULTS The systolic and diastolic BP reduction during the sleep period was similar in ambulatory (-11±2mmHg/- 8±1mmHg) and bed rest conditions (-8±3mmHg/-4±2mmHg; P = 0.38/P = 0.12). The morning surge in diastolic BP was attenuated during bed rest (P = 0.001), and there was a statistical trend for the same effect in systolic BP (P = 0.06).CONCLUSIONS A substantial proportion of the 24-hour BP rhythm remained during bed rest, indicating that typical daily changes in posture and/or physical activity do not entirely explain 24-hour BP variation under normal ambulatory conditions. However, the morning BP increase was attenuated during bed rest, suggesting that the adoption of an upright posture and/or physical activity in the morning contributes to the morning BP surge. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013.

abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between the normal nocturnal decline in blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without high 24-h blood pressure values. Methods: We obtained 24-h ambulatory blood pressure readings from 1542 residents of Ohasama, Japan, who were aged 40 years or more and were representative of the Japanese general population. We then followed up their survival for a mean of 9.2 years. The relationship was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for possible confounding factors. Results: There was a linear relationship between the nocturnal decline in blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality. On average, each 5{\%} decrease in the decline in nocturnal systolic/diastolic blood pressure was associated with an approximately 20{\%} greater risk of cardiovascular mortality. There were no significant interactions for the risk between 24-h systolic/diastolic blood pressure values and continuous values for the nocturnal decline in blood pressure (P for interaction ≥ 0.6). Even when 24-h blood pressure values were within the normal range (≤ 135/80 mmHg, average 118/69 mmHg), diminished nocturnal decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that a diminished nocturnal decline in blood pressure is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, independent of the overall blood pressure load during a 24-h period, in the general population. {\textcopyright} 2002 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

Multiple Cox regression was used to model time to total and cause-specific mortality for ambulatory blood pressure measurement while adjusting for clinic blood pressure measurement and other risk factors at baseline. There were 646 deaths (of which 389 were cardiovascular) during a median follow-up period of 8.4 years. With adjustment for gender, age, risk indices, and clinic blood pressure, higher mean values of ambulatory blood pressure were independent predictors for cardiovascular mortality. The relative hazard ratio for each 10-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure was .1.12 (1.06 to 1.18; P{\textless}0.001) for daytime and, 1.21 (1.15 to 1.27; P{\textless}0.001) for nighttime systolic blood pressure.

The hazard ratios for nighttime ambulatory blood pressure remained significant after adjustment for daytime ambulatory blood pressure. These results have 2 important clinical messages: ambulatory measurement of blood pressure is superior to clinic measurement in predicting cardiovascular mortality, and nighttime blood pressure is the most potent predictor of outcome. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: Lack of reproducibility in medical studies is a barrier to the generation of a robust knowledge base to support clinical decision-making. In this paper we outline the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) Code Repository, a centralized code base for generating reproducible studies on an openly available critical care dataset. Materials and Methods: Code is provided to load the data into a relational structure, create extractions of the data, and reproduce entire analysis plans including research studies. Results: Concepts extracted include severity of illness scores, comorbid status, administrative definitions of sepsis, physiologic criteria for sepsis, organ failure scores, treatment administration, and more. Executable documents are used for tutorials and reproduce published studies end-to-end, providing a template for future researchers to replicate. The repository's issue tracker enables community discussion about the data and concepts, allowing users to collaboratively improve the resource. Discussion: The centralized repository provides a platform for users of the data to interact directly with the data generators, facilitating greater understanding of the data. It also provides a location for the community to collaborate on necessary concepts for research progress and share them with a larger audience. Consistent application of the same code for underlying concepts is a key step in ensuring that research studies on the MIMIC database are comparable and reproducible. Conclusion: By providing open source code alongside the freely accessible MIMIC-III database, we enable endto- end reproducible analysis of electronic health records.},

abstract = {Objective: Measuring arterial pulse transit time (PTT) to estimate blood pressure (BP) without conventional brachial cuff-based measurement is not new, but is a focus of current wearable technologies research. Much research pertains to efficient, accurate sensing of artery-related waveforms, yet the relationship between PTT and BP receives less attention despite being key for accurate BP estimation. This study investigated BP/PTT calibration by quantifying anatomical site variability (n = 10, 3 female, age 30 ± 9 years) and individual variability ( n = 103, 50 female, age 53 ± 22 years). Methods: BP and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured in both seated and supine. Carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV), carotid-radial PWV (crPWV), and carotid-finger-volume PWV (cvPWV) were measured with the wrist and hand positioned at the level of the upper thigh to achieve the same hydrostatic pressure effect across all measurements. Results: The postural change invoked a small (4 ± 7 mmHg) change in brachial diastolic BP with an additional 27 ± 2 mmHg change in hydrostatic pressure. cfPWV decreased in the supine position (-1.75 ± 0.17 m {\textperiodcentered}s-1, p {\textless} 0.001), but crPWV and cvPWV were more variable. The calibration term ($\Delta$ BP/$\Delta$PWV) across the sample population varied from 6.6 to 98.3 mmHg{\textperiodcentered} s{\textperiodcentered}m-1 (mean 22 ± 14 mmHg {\textperiodcentered}s{\textperiodcentered} m-1) and was correlated with age, heart rate, diastolic and pulse pressure, and weight. These variables did not explain the majority of the variability (R2 = 0.248). Conclusion: There is anatomical site and between-individual variability in the calibration term for BP estimation from PTT. Significance: Using and accurately calculating hydrostatic changes in BP within the individual may be one method to increase the accuracy of this calibration term.},

abstract = {A variety of techniques based on the indirect measurement of blood pressure (BP) by Pulse Transit Time (PTT) have been explored over the past few years. Such an approach has the potential in providing continuous and non-invasive beat to beat blood pressure without the use of a cuff. Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) which includes the cardiac pre-ejection period has been proposed as a surrogate of PTT, however, the balance between its questioned accuracy and measurement simplicity has yet to be established. The present work assessed the degree of linear relationship between PAT and blood pressure on 96 h of continuous electrocardiography and invasive radial blood pressure waveforms in a group of 11 young ICU patients. Participants were selected according to strict exclusion criteria including no use of vasoactive medications and presence of clinical conditions associated with cardiovascular diseases. The average range of variation for diastolic BP was 60 to 79 mmHg while systolic BP varied between 123 and 158 mmHg in the study database. The overall Pearson correlation coefficient for systolic and diastolic blood pressure was -0.5 and -0.42, respectively, while the mean absolute error was 3.9 and 7.6 mmHg. It was concluded that the utilization of PAT for the continuous noninvasive blood pressure estimation is rather limited according to the experimental setup, nonetheless the correlation coefficient performed better when the range of variation of blood pressure was high over periods of 30min suggesting that PAT has the potential to be used as indicator of changes relating to hypertensive or hypotensive episodes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an effective algorithm for detecting the onset of arterial blood pressure (ABP) pulses. The algorithm employs a windowed and weighted slope sum function (SSF) to extract ABP waveform features. Adaptive thresholding and search strategies are applied to the SSF signal to detect ABP pulses and to determine their onsets. Two evaluation procedures were employed. First, pulse detection accuracy was evaluated by comparing the algorithm's pulse detections with reference ECG annotations using the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database. The algorithm detected 99.31{\%} of the 368,364 beats annotated in the ECG. Second, the accuracy of pulse onset determination was established using a newly created, manually-edited reference ABP signal database. For 96.41{\%} of the 39,848 beats in the reference database, the difference between the manually-edited and algorithm-determined ABP pulse onset was less than or equal to 20 ms. The C source code of the algorithm has been contributed to PhysioToolkit and is freely available from the PhysioNet website (http://www.physionet.org).},

abstract = {Current monitoring systems available to track changes in the vital signs of patients (such as heart rate, respiratory rate or peripheral oxygen saturation) require contact with the subject. Most patients requiring regular monitoring find the probes difficult to wear over prolonged periods of time. Research in non-contact vital sign monitoring has recently expanded through the use of off-the-shelf video cameras; nevertheless, most of the current work in video-based non-contact vital sign monitoring has so far been performed over short time periods (typically up to a couple of minutes), under tightly controlled conditions with relatively still and healthy volunteer subjects. Using an off-the-shelf camera, we have been able to compute estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate, and also detect changes in peripheral oxygen saturation in a real hospital scenario, without interfering with regular patient care. Videos were recorded for 369.1 hours from 40 patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment in the Renal Unit of the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, UK. The mean absolute error between the heart rate estimates from the camera and the average from two reference pulse oximeters (positioned at the finger and earlobe respectively) was 2.8 beats per minute for over 65{\%} of the time, which was comparable to the error between the two reference pulse oximeters. The mean absolute error between the respiratory rate estimates from the camera and the reference values (computed from the Electrocardiogram and a thoracic expansion sensor - chest belt) was 2.1 breaths per minute for over 69{\%} of the time for which the reference signals were valid. By calibrating the camera data with the reference pulse oximeters, changes in peripheral oxygen saturation could also be tracked during time periods with minimal patient motion.},

The user presses her fingertip on both the front camera and screen to increase the external pressure of the underlying artery, while the application measures the resulting variable-amplitude blood volume oscillations via the camera and applied pressure via the strain gauge array under the screen. The application also visually guides the fingertip placement and actuation and then computes BP from the measurements just like many automatic cuff devices. We tested the application, along with a finger cuff device, against a standard cuff device. The application yielded bias and precision errors of −4.0 and 11.4 mmHg for systolic BP and −9.4 and 9.7 mmHg for diastolic BP (n = 18). These errors were near the finger cuff device errors. This proof-of-concept study surprisingly indicates that cuff-less and calibration-free BP monitoring may be feasible with many existing and forthcoming smartphones.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Reliable information about the prevalence of hypertension in different world regions is essential to the development of national and international health policies for prevention and control of this condition. We aimed to pool data from different regions of the world to estimate the overall prevalence and absolute burden of hypertension in 2000, and to estimate the global burden in 2025. METHODS We searched the published literature from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2002, using MEDLINE, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies of retrieved articles. We included studies that reported sex-specific and age-specific prevalence of hypertension in representative population samples. All data were obtained independently by two investigators with a standardised protocol and data-collection form. RESULTS Overall, 26.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 26.0-26.8{\%}) of the adult population in 2000 had hypertension (26.6{\%} of men [26.0-27.2{\%}] and 26.1{\%} of women [25.5-26.6{\%}]), and 29.2{\%} (28.8-29.7{\%}) were projected to have this condition by 2025 (29.0{\%} of men [28.6-29.4{\%}] and 29.5{\%} of women [29.1-29.9{\%}]). The estimated total number of adults with hypertension in 2000 was 972 million (957-987 million); 333 million (329-336 million) in economically developed countries and 639 million (625-654 million) in economically developing countries. The number of adults with hypertension in 2025 was predicted to increase by about 60{\%} to a total of 1.56 billion (1.54-1.58 billion). INTERPRETATION Hypertension is an important public-health challenge worldwide. Prevention, detection, treatment, and control of this condition should receive high priority.},

Methods: Twenty-six hypertensive subjects consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation unit over a six-month period were recruited. Exclusion criteria concerned all clinical conditions potentially related to BP variability or leading to CD. All patients underwent a clinic and 24-h BP non-invasive monitoring assessment of BP, as well as a cognitive assessment with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The presence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) was assessed on CT films, with a standardized visual rating scale. Results: Blunted reduction of both systolic and diastolic night-time BP were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performances (r = 0.61, p = 0.001 for systolic; and r = 0.57, p = 0.002 for diastolic, respectively). In a multiple regression model, blunted reduction of night-time BP (B = 0.17, [95{\%} confidence intervals: 1.1-1.3], p = 0.008 for systolic; and B = 0.15, [95{\%} confidence intervals: 1.0-1.3], p = 0.02 for diastolic) independently predicted poorer cognitive performances.

abstract = {Background: The prognostic value of nocturnal blood pressure (BP) reduction in resistant hypertension (RH) is unknown. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate its importance as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Methods: At baseline, 556 patients with RH underwent clinical and laboratory examinations and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. The primary end points were a composite of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Multiple Cox regression was used to assess associations between the nocturnal BP reduction and the subsequent end points. Results: After a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 1-103 months), 109 patients (19.6{\%}) reached the composite end point, with 70 all-cause and 46 cardiovascular deaths. A nondipping pattern was present in 360 patients (65.0{\%}). After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, smoking status, physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, previous cardiovascular disease, number of antihypertensive drugs in use, and office and 24-hour ambulatory BP readings, the nondipping pattern was an independent predictor of the composite end point (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.71) and of cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.31; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-4.92). In subgroup analysis, the reduced (HR, 1.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-2.83) and reverted (HR, 1.89; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-3.43) dipping patterns were predictive of total cardiovascular events. The effect of the nondipping pattern on cardiovascular prognosis was stronger in younger patients and in those with true RH. Conclusions: The nocturnal BP variability patterns provide valuable prognostic information for stratification of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk in patients with RH, above and beyond other traditional cardiovascular risk factors and mean ambulatory BP levels. {\textcopyright}2009 American Medical Association.

abstract = {Arterial cannulation is a procedure frequently performed in acute and critical care settings. It serves as an invasive means to more accurately measure blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than non-invasive means. Artery cannulation gives precise measurements that allow for immediate recognition of alterations, thus allowing for quicker intervention and potential stabilization of a patient. In addition to accurate arterial pressures, arterial cannulation may also serve as a means to collect blood gas samples repetitively without requiring additional punctures and increasing the potential for injury. There are multiple sites for arterial cannulation including but not limited to radial, brachial, and femoral arteries. The radial artery is the most utilized for access in adults and pediatrics. Arterial cannulation is a relatively safe procedure that poses little risk of complication when performed by an appropriately skilled practitioner.[1][2][3][4] There are several indications for which arterial cannulation may be considered. The most obvious being invasive blood pressure monitoring and accurate mean arterial pressures. Arterial cannulation may also be considered in patients who will require frequent arterial blood samples or in patients which non-invasive blood pressure monitoring is excluded such as those with large surface area burns, severe hypotension, multiple extremity fractures, or morbid obesity. As in any procedure that has indications, there are also contraindications to arterial cannulation. One of the most common contraindications for arterial cannulation is anticoagulation, especially in those who have recently received thrombolytics for an acute infarct. Other contraindications include coagulopathy, arterial atherosclerosis, insufficient collateral perfusion, partial or full thickness burns over the cannulation site, synthetic arterial or vascular grafts, or infection at the proposed site of cannulation. Caution must be used if one chooses to proceed with arterial cannulation despite the posed contraindications. The procedure has been successfully performed in the presence of contraindications; however, it is not encouraged unless there are extenuating circumstances in which the practitioner feels the procedure is necessary. Absolute contraindications for arterial cannulation are absent pulse, Raynaud Syndrome, full thickness burns over the proposed site of cannulation, inadequate or interrupted circulation. Despite the list of contraindications, there is a less than one percent chance for major complications with arterial cannulation. A risk to benefit analysis should be performed in each patient prior to proceeding with arterial cannulation.},

abstract = {Periodic, quantitative measurement of blood pressure (BP) in humans, predating the era of evidence-based medicine by over a century, is a component of the American Society of Anesthesiologists standards for basic anesthetic monitoring and is a staple of anesthetic management worldwide. Adherence to traditional BP parameters complicates the ability of investigators to determine whether particular BP ranges confer any clinical benefits. The BP waveform is a complex amalgamation of both antegrade and retrograde (reflected) pressure waves and is affected by vascular compliance, distance from the left ventricle, and the 3D structure of the vascular tree. Although oscillometry is the standard method of measuring BP semicontinuously in anesthetized patients and is the primary form of measurement in {\textgreater}80{\%} of general anesthetics, major shortcomings of oscillometry are its poor performance at the extremes and its lack of information concerning BP waveform. Although arterial catheterization remains the gold standard for accurate BP measurement, 2 classes of devices have been developed to noninvasively measure the BP waveform continuously, including tonometric and volume clamp devices. Described in terms of a feedback loop, control of BP requires measurement, an algorithm (usually human), and an intervention. This narrative review article discusses the details of BP measurement and the advantages and disadvantages of both noninvasive and invasive monitoring, as well as the principles and algorithms associated with each technique.},

abstract = {A technique for ambulatory diagnosis of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children based on pulse photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal is presented. Decreases in amplitude fluctuations of the PPG signal (DAP) events have been proposed as OSAS discriminator, since they are related to vasoconstriction associated to apnea. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during these DAP events has been proposed to discriminate between DAP events related or unrelated to an apneic event. The use of HRV requires electrocardiogram (ECG) as an additional recording, meaning a disadvantage that takes more relevance in sleep studies context where the number of sensors is tried to be minimized in order not to affect the physiological sleep. This study proposes the use of pulse rate variability (PRV) extracted from the PPG signal instead of HRV. Polysomnographic registers from 21 children (aged 4.47 ± 2.04 years) were studied. The subject classification based on DAP events and PRV analysis obtained an accuracy of 86.67{\%} which represents an improvement of 6.67{\%} with respect to the HRV analysis. These results suggest that PRV can be used in apnea detectors based on DAP events, to discriminate apneic from nonapneic events avoiding the need for ECG recordings. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Although respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a well-known and often studied phenomenon, methods to estimate (average) respiratory rate from heart rate variability via RSA have been investigated and published only sparsely. We reinvestigate three published techniques and contrast them to our own approaches. All methods were also evaluated for respiration signals to yield approximations of the true breathing rate for comparison. Our analyses are based on physiological recordings available at PhysioNet, an online database. Results show that the RSA of young supine subjects yields good approximations of mean respiratory rate in the case of time series longer than 1 min, while the estimations become noticeably less accurate for elderly persons. Our own "advanced counting method" produced the best results, and in addition principally permits even the definition of instantaneous respiratory rates. Consequently, it is recommended for further investigations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {Respiration rate (RR) is a physiological parameter that is typically used in clinical settings for monitoring patient condition. Consequently, it is measured in a wide range of clinical scenarios, notably absent from which is measurement using wearable sensors. With increasing numbers of patients being monitored via wearable sensors, as described below, there is an urgent need to be able to estimate RR from such sensors in a robust manner. In this chapter, we describe a novel technique for measuring RR using waveform data acquired from wearable sensors. The technique derives RR from a physiological signal which is routinely acquired by many mobile sensors: the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Each RR measurement from the proposed method is accompanied by a confidence measure, providing estimates of clinical quality that will allow the system to, for example, only report RR values when they exceed some probabilistic level of certainty. The goal of this method is to improve upon existing methods, which simply report RR values without probabilistic estimation, and which therefore suffer the lack of robustness that prevents their use in clinical practice.},

abstract = {We present a novel method for estimating respiratory rate in real time from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) obtained from pulse oximetry. Three respiratory-induced variations (frequency, intensity, and amplitude) are extracted from the PPG using the Incremental-Merge Segmentation algorithm. Frequency content of each respiratory-induced variation is analyzed using fast Fourier transforms. The proposed Smart Fusion method then combines the results of the three respiratory-induced variations using a transparent mean calculation. It automatically eliminates estimations considered to be unreliable because of detected presence of artifacts in the PPG or disagreement between the different individual respiratory rate estimations. The algorithm has been tested on data obtained from 29 children and 13 adults. Results show that it is important to combine the three respiratory-induced variations for robust estimation of respiratory rate. The Smart Fusion showed trends of improved estimation (mean root mean square error 3.0 breaths/min) compared to the individual estimation methods (5.8, 6.2, and 3.9 breaths/min). The Smart Fusion algorithm is being implemented in a mobile phone pulse oximeter device to facilitate the diagnosis of severe childhood pneumonia in remote areas. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

Its real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection and segmentation problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions. The ER detector is robust against blur, low contrast and illumination, color and texture variation. In the first stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using features calculated by a novel algorithm in constant time and only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification accuracy is improved using computationally more expensive features. A highly efficient clustering algorithm then groups ERs into text lines and an OCR classifier trained on synthetic fonts is exploited to label character regions. The most probable character sequence is selected in the last stage when the context of each character is known. The method was evaluated on three public datasets. On the ICDAR 2013 dataset the method achieves state-of-the-art results in text localization; on the more challenging SVT dataset, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates that the proposed pipeline can incorporate additional prior knowledge about the detected text.

This ill-posed inverse problem is typically regularized by forcing spatial smoothness on the recoverable illumination. Recent work in this field suggested exploiting the knowledge that the illumination image bounds the image from above, and the fact that the reflectance is also expected to be smooth. In this paper we show how the above model can be improved to provide a non-iterative retinex algorithm that handles better edges in the illumination, and suppresses noise in dark areas. This algorithm uses two specially tailored bilateral filters - the first evaluates the illumination and the other is used for the computation of the reflectance. This result stands as a theoretic justification and refinement for the recently proposed heuristic use of the bilateral filter for retinex by Durand and Dorsey. In line with their appealing way of speeding up the bilateral filter, we show that similar speedup methods apply to our algorithm. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

However, processing PPG signals measured after exercise is challenging, especially if the environment is hot and humid. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can detect systolic peaks under challenging conditions, as in the case of emergency responders in tropical conditions. Accurate systolic-peak detection is an important first step for the analysis of heart rate variability. Algorithms based on local maxima-minima, first-derivative, and slope sum are evaluated, and a new algorithm is introduced to improve the detection rate. With 40 healthy subjects, the new algorithm demonstrates the highest overall detection accuracy (99.84{\%} sensitivity, 99.89{\%} positive predictivity). Existing algorithms, such as Billauer's, Li's and Zong's, have comparable although lower accuracy. However, the proposed algorithm presents an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. For best performance, we show that a combination of two event-related moving averages with an offset threshold has an advantage in detecting systolic peaks, even in heat-stressed PPG signals. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elgendi et al.},

abstract = {Preprocessing techniques are designed to improve the linear relationship between the spectral signals and analyte concentrations. These techniques can be divided into two major groups that include those that directly use available reference values for the preprocessing operation and those that do not. The latter group is thus a reference-independent preprocessing group, and as such provides more general tools suitable for studies such as exploratory studies, where often no reference value is available. The reference-independent techniques can further be divided into two subgroups: scatter correction methods and derivation methods. Scatter correction methods include multiplicative signal correction (MSC), also known as multiplicative scatter correction (including extended MSC, inverse MSC, inverse extended MSC, and de-trending), standard normal variate (SNV) scaling, and normalization, and baseline correction. Derivation includes finite difference, Savitzky-Golay, and Norris-Williams, techniques. The basic concept of the MSC is to remove nonlinearities in the data caused by scatter from particulates in the samples. The MSC operation is divided into two steps: estimation of the correction coefficients, and correction of the spectra. There are two typical types of normalization used on spectral data that include total absolute sum and square root of the total squared sum (Euclidean norm). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The scheme determines subject-specific contribution to PPG signal and removes most of its influence by proper normalization. Key features such as amplitudes and phases of cardiac components were extracted by a fast Fourier transform and were used to train an artificial neural network, which was then used to estimate BP from PPG. Validation was done on 69 patients from the MIMIC II database plus 23 volunteers. All estimations showed a good correlation with the reference values. This method is fast and robust, and can potentially be used to perform pulse wave analysis in addition to BP estimation.},

abstract = {Objective: This paper proposes an unobtrusive blood pressure (BP) measurement system design with a motion artifact (MA) compensation strategy as a potential surrogate to the traditional cuff-based sphygmomanometer for self-monitoring in a less restricted environment. Approach: A dual-channel photoplethysmographic signal acquisition system is designed and implemented for cuff-less BP measurement based on the peripheral pulse transit time (PPTT) acquired from the forearm and wrist. Comprising a motion decision, singular spectrum analysis, PPTT calculation and BP measurement, a novel approach is proposed to realize BP measurements and suppress MA interference. Main results: Compared with the reference BP recorded by a cuff-based sphygmomanometer, our preliminary examinations on 30 subjects found that the correlation coefficients for systolic BP estimation and diastolic BP estimation were 0.75 and 0.78, and the mean absolute differences were 7.61 mmHg and 6.82 mmHg, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed approach was compared with the other most widely used pulse transit time (PTT) measuring methods and BP-PTT models. All the results indicate that our work was highly effective in realizing the BP measurement. Significance: The proposed system and approach have resulted in remarkable progress in cuff-less BP measurements with MA removal, and have great potential value in wearable applications without environmental restrictions.},

abstract = {Using the massive MIMIC physiological database, we tried to validate pulse wave analysis (PWA) based on multiparameters model whether it can continuously estimate blood pressure (BP) values on single site of one hand. In addition, to consider the limitation of insufficient data acquirement for home user, we used pulse arrival time (PAT) driven BP information to determine the individual scale factors of the PWA-BP estimation model. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the average regression model has error standard deviations of 10.6 ± 3.3 mmHg (PAT), 8.7 ± 3.2 mmHg (PWA) for SBP and 6.0 ± 2.3 mmHg (PAT), 4.4 ± 1.6 mmHg (PWA) for DBP on 23 subjects over a 1 day period. We defined a local-model which is extracted regression model from sparsely selected small dataset, contrast to full dataset for 24h (average-model). The limit of BP estimation accuracy from the local-model of PWA is lower than that of PAT-BP average-model. Whereas the error of the BP estimation local-model was reduced using more data for scaling, it required more than four times the 1 min data extracted over the 12 h calibration period to predict BP for 1 day. This study shows that PWA has possibility to estimate BP value and PAT-driven BP information could be used to determine the individual scale factors of the PWA-BP estimation model for home users.},

The traditional method of blood pressure measurement is most based on Korotkoff sound, which need to put pressure on individuals, operate tediously, can not monitor continuously, and is easy to cause discomfort to the individuals, so it is necessary to seek a better method for continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. Thanks to the development of sensor technology, people can easily obtain Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals of human pulse, and many studies have also made estimation of blood pressure based on PPG signals. One kind of method can indirectly obtain pulse transit time using PPG signal, and then inferred the blood pressure, but there is also a problem of complex operation; another class of method extracted useful features from the PPG signal, and then built a model on features to estimate the blood pressure. On this basis, this paper built linear and nonlinear estimation model on PPG signals and blood pressure, based on the method of machine learning, and then improved the model by combining with clustering and gradient boosting techniques. The experimental results show that this model can effectively improve the effect of blood pressure estimation.},

abstract = {Digital spectral analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals provides quantitative markers of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, underpinning a variety of physiologic processes. In this investigation, a robust algorithm was developed to derive HRV signals, their FFT- or AR-based spectra and their standard spectral features from either electrocardiogram (ECG) or photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals. ECG/PPG signals were first interpolated to a common sampling rate and detrended using a first order DC-notch IIR high-pass filter to remove very low frequencies. Next, the undecimated Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) Daubechies-6 family of filters was used to selectively remove some of the highfrequency subbands from the signals. The filtered ECG/PPG signals were then squared to increase the dynamic range of the target dominant peaks from which accurate peak-to-peak intervals could be extracted. A smart peak-tracking and monitoring algorithm was used to detect the peaks while enforcing a valid trend of the instantaneous heart rate. Once the peak-to-peak intervals were obtained, the HRV signal was determined using cubic spline interpolation to create a signal at a very low sampling rate of 1-4 Hz. Standard Power Spectrum Estimation (PSD) of the HRV signal was then performed to generate normalized LF, HF and LF/HF spectral features to quantify parasympathetic influences and sympathovagal balance. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

However, due to the varying environments in which wearable devices are used and, consequently, their varying susceptibility to noise interference, effective processing of PPG signals is challenging. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the optimal filter and filter order to be used for PPG signal processing to make the systolic and diastolic waves more salient in the filtered PPG signal using the skewness quality index. Nine types of filters with 10 different orders were used to filter 219 (2.1s) short PPG signals. The signals were divided into three categories by PPG experts according to their noise levels: excellent, acceptable, or unfit. Results show that the Chebyshev II filter can improve the PPG signal quality more effectively than other types of filters and that the optimal order for the Chebyshev II filter is the 4 th order.},

PPG signals collected via mobile devices are prone to artifacts that negatively impact measurement accuracy, which can lead to a significant number of misleading diagnoses. Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect PPG signals, developing an optimal signal quality index (SQI) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight SQIs were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all PPG data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each PPG signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent PPG and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall F 1 scores of 86.0{\%}, 87.2{\%}, and 79.1{\%}, respectively.},

We calculated the heart beat rate per minute (BPM) from the reconstructed PPG signals and evaluated the performance of the proposed method in terms of Absolute Maximum Error (AME) and Mean Sum Error (MSE) with the provided ground-truth BPM computed from ECG signals. We have shown an improvement in the MSE values from 67{\%} of the datasets used in this study.

We propose RR estimation based on photoplethysmography (PPG) because the blood perfusion dynamics are known to carry information on breathing, as respiration-induced modulations in the PPG signal. We studied the use of amplitude variability of transmittance mode finger PPG signal in RR estimation by comparing four time-frequency (TF) representation methods of the signal cascaded with a particle filter. The TF methods compared were short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and three types of synchrosqueezing methods. The public VORTAL database was used in this study. The results indicate that the advanced frequency reallocation methods based on synchrosqueezing approach may present improvement over linear methods, such as STFT. The best results were achieved using wavelet synchrosqueezing transform, having a mean absolute error and median error of 2.33 and 1.15 breaths per minute, respectively. Synchrosqueezing methods were generally more accurate than STFT on most of the subjects when particle filtering was applied. While TF analysis combined with particle filtering is a promising alternative for real-time estimation of RR, artefacts and non-respiration-related frequency components remain problematic and impose requirements for further studies in the areas of signal processing algorithms an PPG instrumentation.},

abstract = {The arterial blood pressure (ABP) is one of the most important physiological parameters for health monitoring. Most of the blood measurement devices in the market determine the ABP through the inflation and the deflation of a cuff controlled by a bladder. This method is very uncomfortable for most of the users and may even cause anxiety, which in turn can affect the blood pressure (BP) (white coat syndrome). This paper investigates a cuffless nonintrusive approach to estimate the BP. The main idea is to measure the pulse transit time (PTT), i.e., the delay between the R-peak of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the following peak of the finger photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal. The main problem of this approach is that when the dicrotic notch of the PPG signal is unobservable, the position and the amplitude of the main peak of the PPG signal will be changed. As a result, the correlation between the BP and the PTT can be affected. To overcome this problem, three types of secondary peak detection methods are designed to reveal the secondary peak from the original PPG signal. Actual ECG, PPG, and the BP measurements extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database that contains clinical signal data reflecting real measurements are used. The results verify that the proposed detection methods improve the correlation relationship between the BP and the PTT, and demonstrate that the adjusted PTT can be used as an indicator of the ABP by removing the dicrotic notch impact on the PPG signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Physiological signals are widely used to perform medical assessment for monitoring an extensive range of pathologies, usually related to cardio-vascular diseases. Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is an important and useful index to assess the responses of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). HRV analysis is performed using electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals which are typically subject to noise and trends. Therefore, the elimination of these undesired conditions is very important to achieve reliable ANS activation results. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the effects of preprocessing on the spectral analysis of HRV signals obtained from PPG waveform. Preprocessing consists of two stages: filtering and detrending. The performance of linear Butterworth filter is compared with nonlinear weighted Myriad filter. After filtering, two different approaches, one based on least squares fitting and another on smoothness priors, were used to remove trends from the HRV signal. The results of two filtering and detrending methods were compared for spectral analysis accomplished using periodogram, Welch's periodogram and Burg's method. The performance of these methods is presented graphically and the importance of preprocessing clarified by comparing the results. Although both filters have almost the same performance in the results, the smoothness prior detrending approach was found more successful in removing trends that usually appear in the low frequency bands of PPG signals. In conclusion, the results showed that trends in PPG signals are altered during spectral analysis and must be removed prior to HRV analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is mainly because of their salient features like, simple construction, low cost, easy to use, relatively inexpensive nature etc. Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is one among the wide variety of optical sensors available, and is used to measure the blood volumetric changes occurring in the various parts of the body. PPG signal contains rich source of information related to cardio-pulmonary system. But the major problem associated with the signal is the motion artifacts, causing corruption in the original PPG signal. The aim of this study is to know in deep about the different parameters of PPG signal. Peak and transition points of the pulse signal are determined as a part of pulse wave analysis. Wavelet transform is now commonly used in a wide variety of signal processing applications. In this work wavelet de-noising is used for removing AWGN from the PPG signal.

abstract = {Existing methods for arterial blood pressure (BP) estimation directly map the input physiological signals to output BP values without explicitly modeling the underlying temporal dependencies in BP dynamics. As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating BP estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep RNN to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep RNN model was tested on a static BP dataset, and it achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.90 and 2.66 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional BP prediction models. On a multi-day BP dataset, the deep RNN achieved RMSE of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 mmHg for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day SBP prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 mmHg for corresponding DBP prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement. The experimental results suggest that modeling the temporal dependencies in BP dynamics significantly improves the long-term BP prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is commonly used to assess the circadian pattern of BP. Circadian BP pattern is influenced by physical activity and sleep cycle. The effect of BP monitoring itself on the level of physical activity and sleep remains unknown. If BP monitoring affects these parameters, then monitoring itself may influence the circadian BP pattern. Design, setting, participants, {\&} measurements: To assess the effect of ambulatory BP monitoring on sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and daytime activity, we measured physical activity using wrist actigraphy in 103 veterans with chronic kidney disease. After 6 to 7 days of continuous activity monitoring, participants underwent ambulatory BP monitoring with simultaneous actigraphy. The above experiment was repeated after 1 mo. Results: Among the top tertile of patients (most sleep), when wearing ambulatory BP patients spent less time in bed at night (-92 min, P {\textless} 0.0001), were less asleep during those hours (-98 min, P {\textless} 0.0001), and had reduced sleep efficiency (82{\%} versus 77{\%}, -5{\%} P = 0.02). On the day of ambulatory BP monitoring, patients were more sedentary during waking hours (+27 minutes, P = 0.002). During ambulatory BP monitoring, waking after sleep onset more than median was associated with greater odds for nondipping (odds ratio 10.5, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with disturbed sleep and reduced physical activity, characteristics that influence dipping. Ambulatory BP monitoring may itself induce nondipping and may thus mitigate the prognostic significance of the dipping phenomenon.

abstract = {Objective: Pulse transit time (PTT) is being widely pursued for ubiquitous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. PTT-based systems may require periodic cuff calibrations but can still be useful for hypertension screening by affording numerous out-of-clinic measurements that can be averaged. The objective was to predict the maximum calibration period that would not compromise accuracy and acceptable error limits in light of measurement averaging for PTT-based systems. Methods: Well-known mathematical models and vast BP data were leveraged. Models relating PTT, age, and gender to BP were employed to determine the maximum time period for the PTT-BP calibration curve to change by {\textless}1 mmHg over physiological BP ranges for each age and gender. A model of within-person BP variability was employed to establish the screening accuracy of the conventional cuff-based approach. These models were integrated to investigate the screening accuracy of the average of numerous measurements of a PTT-based system in relation to the accuracy of its individual measurements. Results: The maximum calibration period was about 1 year for a 30 year old and declined linearly to about 6 months for a 70 year old. A PTT-based system with a precision error of {\textgreater}12 mmHg for systolic BP could achieve the screening accuracy of the cuff-based approach via measurement averaging. Conclusion: This theoretical study indicates that PTT-based BP monitoring is viable even with periodic calibration and seemingly high measurement errors. Significance: The predictions may help guide the implementation, evaluation, and application of PTT-based BP monitoring systems in practice.},

abstract = {Objective: The goal was to propose and establish the proof of concept of an ultraconvenient cuffless blood pressure monitoring approach based on the ballistocardiogram. Methods: The proposed approach monitors blood pressure by exploiting two features in the whole-body head-to-foot ballistocardiogram measured using a force plate: the time interval between the first ('I') and second ('J') major waves ('I-J interval') for diastolic pressure and the amplitude between the J and third major ('K') waves ('J-K amplitude') for pulse pressure. The efficacy of the approach was examined in 22 young healthy volunteers by investigating the diastolic pressure monitoring performance of pulse transit time, pulse arrival time, and ballistocardiogram's I-J interval, and the systolic pressure monitoring performance of pulse transit time and I-J interval in conjunction with ballistocardiogram's J-K amplitude. Results: The I-J interval was comparable to pulse transit time and pulse arrival time in monitoring diastolic pressure, and the J-K amplitude could provide meaningful improvement to pulse transit time and I-J interval in monitoring systolic pressure. Conclusion: The ballistocardiogram may contribute toward ultraconvenient and more accurate cuffless blood pressure monitoring. Significance: The proposed approach has potential to complement the pulse transit time technique for cuffless blood pressure monitoring in two ways. First, it may be integrated with pulse transit time to enable independent monitoring of diastolic and systolic pressures via the J-K amplitude. Second, it may even enable diastolic and systolic pressure monitoring from the ballistocardiogram alone.},

abstract = {Objective: We propose a calibration-free method and system for cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement from superficial arteries. A prototype device with bi-modal probe arrangement was designed and developed to estimate carotid BP - an indicator of central aortic pressure. Methods: Mathematical models relating BP parameters of an arterial segment to its dimensions and local pulse wave velocity (PWV) are introduced. A bi-modal probe utilizing ultrasound and photoplethysmograph sensors was developed and used to measure diameter values and local PWV from the carotid artery. Carotid BP was estimated using the measured physiological parameters without any subject- or population-specific calibration procedures. The proposed cuffless BP estimation method and system were tested for accuracy, usability, and for potential utility in hypertension screening, on a total of 83 subjects. Results: The prototype device demonstrated its capability of detecting beat-by-beat arterial dimensions and local PWV simultaneously. Carotid diastolic BP (DBP) and systolic BP (SBP) were estimated over multiple cardiac cycles in real-time. The absolute error in carotid DBP was {\textless}10 mmHg in 82{\%} cases, and root-mean-square-error = 8.3 mmHg. Consistent with the theory, estimated SBP at the carotid site was lower than the reference brachial SBP. ROC curves obtained for hypertension screening analysis revealed an area under the curve ≥0.8 for both carotid SBP and DBP values, illustrating the potential for using the developed method in hypertension screening. Conclusion: The feasibility of calibration-free, cuffless BP measurement at an arterial site of interest was demonstrated with a level of acceptable accuracy. The study also demonstrated the potential utility of the proposed method and system in hypertension screening and local evaluation of arterial stiffness indices. Significance: Novel approach for calibration-free cuffless BP estimation; a potential tool for local BP measurement and hypertension screening.},

Long-term abnormal blood pressure will lead to various cardiovascular diseases, making the early detection and assessment of hypertension profoundly significant for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we investigate whether or not deep learning can provide better results for hypertension risk stratification when compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction methods. We tested a deep learning method for the classification and evaluation of hypertension using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals based on the continuous wavelet transform (using Morse) and pretrained convolutional neural network (using GoogLeNet). We collected 121 data recordings from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) Database, each containing arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The ABP signals were utilized to extract blood pressure category labels, and the PPG signals were used to train and test the model. According to the seventh report of the Joint National Committee, blood pressure levels are categorized as normotension (NT), prehypertension (PHT), and hypertension (HT). For the early diagnosis and assessment of HT, the timely detection of PHT and the accurate diagnosis of HT are significant. Therefore, three HT classification trials were set: NT vs. PHT, NT vs. HT, and (NT + PHT) vs. HT. The F-scores of these three classification trials were 80.52{\%}, 92.55{\%}, and 82.95{\%}, respectively. The tested deep method achieved higher accuracy for hypertension risk stratification when compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction method. Additionally, the method achieved comparable results to another approach that requires electrocardiogram and PPG signals.},

However, such readers are usually more expensive than similar devices without an embedded communication module. Further, different vendors define proprietary communication protocols and data formats for their own medical sensors. Due to the twin issues of high cost and diversity of standards, the automatic collection of patients' vital signs is not common in hospitals, meaning that medical staff need to periodically collect all patients' vital signs. This may cause further problems in caring for patients. We propose a low-cost reader using a cheap web camera to automatically read vital sign monitors in hospitals. The reader uses a high-resolution web camera to take a series of pictures of vital sign monitors and recognizes vital signs in electronic form and then forwards that information to hospital information systems. Its major benefit is that different sensors equipped with vital sign monitors, whether they include a computer communications module, can be digital-number recognized. It saves time in recording monitored vital signs of patients widely located in hospitals. In sum medical staff care of patients may be usefully assisted by the proposed reader which automatically collects all patients' vital signs, significantly improving patient care. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder-Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer.

In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image.},

@article{Vorontsov2013JaccardModels,
abstract = {Background: Positional weight matrix (PWM) remains the most popular for quantification of transcription factor (TF) binding. PWM supplied with a score threshold defines a set of putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), thus providing a TFBS model.TF binding DNA fragments obtained by different experimental methods usually give similar but not identical PWMs. This is also common for different TFs from the same structural family. Thus it is often necessary to measure the similarity between PWMs. The popular tools compare PWMs directly using matrix elements. Yet, for log-odds PWMs, negative elements do not contribute to the scores of highly scoring TFBS and thus may be different without affecting the sets of the best recognized binding sites. Moreover, the two TFBS sets recognized by a given pair of PWMs can be more or less different depending on the score thresholds.Results: We propose a practical approach for comparing two TFBS models, each consisting of a PWM and the respective scoring threshold. The proposed measure is a variant of the Jaccard index between two TFBS sets. The measure defines a metric space for TFBS models of all finite lengths. The algorithm can compare TFBS models constructed using substantially different approaches, like PWMs with raw positional counts and log-odds. We present the efficient software implementation: MACRO-APE (MAtrix CompaRisOn by Approximate P-value Estimation).Conclusions: MACRO-APE can be effectively used to compute the Jaccard index based similarity for two TFBS models. A two-pass scanning algorithm is presented to scan a given collection of PWMs for PWMs similar to a given query.Availability and implementation: MACRO-APE is implemented in ruby 1.9; software including source code and a manual is freely available at http://autosome.ru/macroape/ and in supplementary materials. {\textcopyright} 2013 Vorontsov et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables.

@article{ParisAApproach,
abstract = {The bilateral filter is a nonlinear filter that smoothes a signal while preserving strong edges. It has demonstrated great effectiveness for a variety of problems in computer vision and computer graphics, and fast versions have been proposed. Unfortunately, little is known about the accuracy of such accelerations. In this paper, we propose a new signal-processing analysis of the bilateral filter which complements the recent studies that analyzed it as a PDE or as a robust statistical estimator. The key to our analysis is to express the filter in a higher-dimensional space where the signal intensity is added to the original domain dimensions. Importantly, this signal-processing perspective allows us to develop a novel bilateral filtering acceleration using downsampling in space and intensity. This affords a principled expression of accuracy in terms of bandwidth and sampling. The bilateral filter can be expressed as linear convolutions in this augmented space followed by two simple nonlinearities. This allows us to derive criteria for downsampling the key operations and achieving important acceleration of the bilateral filter. We show that, for the same running time, our method is more accurate than previous acceleration techniques. Typically, we are able to process a 2 megapixel image using our acceleration technique in less than a second, and have the result be visually similar to the exact computation that takes several tens of minutes. The acceleration is most effective with large spatial kernels. Furthermore, this approach extends naturally to color images and cross bilateral filtering. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In the paper, the scale of Gauss filters are set as 5, 9, 13, 25, and their variance set as 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 respectively. 6 adjacent frame images are selected, and the uniform and optical background image for these 6 images can be extracted by maximum method.

@article{allen2007photoplethysmography,
abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

K-calibration algorithm is used in the software part of this system. The main idea of K-calibration algorithm is to calibrate the constant K value on the basis of the relationship between the stroke volume (SV) and PPG from invasive SV, then combine the K value and the noninvasive PPG to calculate the SV, and calculate CO from SV. We collect the invasive SV by FloTrac / Vigileo monitor, and at the same time collect the PPG signals and some other parameters, then combine the calibrated K value and PPG to calculate SV. After making a correlation analysis with the calculated SV and the invasive SV, the result shows that they have a good correlation with each other. Making a comparison between the continuous CO collected by our designed monitoring system in real time and the invasive CO collected by the FloTrac / Vigileo monitoring system will be our follow-up job.

@misc{Monnet2017,
abstract = {Background: For complex patients in the intensive care unit or in the operating room, many questions regarding their haemodynamic management cannot be answered with simple clinical examination. In particular, arterial pressure allows only a rough estimation of cardiac output. Transpulmonary thermodilution is a technique that provides a full haemodynamic assessment through cardiac output and other indices. Main body: Through the analysis of the thermodilution curve recorded at the tip of an arterial catheter after the injection of a cold bolus in the venous circulation, transpulmonary thermodilution intermittently measures cardiac output. This measure allows the calibration of pulse contour analysis. This provides continuous and real time monitoring of cardiac output, which is not possible with the pulmonary artery catheter. Transpulmonary thermodilution provides several variables beyond cardiac output. It estimates the end-diastolic volume of the four cardiac cavities, which is a marker of cardiac preload. It provides an estimation of the systolic function of the combined ventricles. It is more direct than the pulmonary artery catheter, but does not allow the distinct estimation of right and left cardiac function. It is easier and faster to perform than echocardiography, but does not provide a full evaluation of the cardiac structure and function. Transpulmonary thermodilution has the unique advantage of being able to estimate at the bedside extravascular lung water, which quantifies the volume of pulmonary oedema, and pulmonary vascular permeability, which quantifies the degree of a pulmonary capillary leak. Both indices are helpful for guiding fluid strategy, especially in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusions: Transpulmonary thermodilution provides a full cardiovascular evaluation that allows one to answer many questions regarding haemodynamic management. It belongs to the category of "advanced" devices that are indicated for the most critically ill and/or complex patients.},

Methods: This prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30 min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland-Altman analysis was performed. Results: A total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were -2.98 ± 19.35, -3.38 ± 10.35, and -3.65 ± 8.69 mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively. Conclusions: BP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM.},

abstract = {Objective: This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects. Methodology: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels. Results: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were RSBP2=0.91, RDBP2=0.89, and RBGL2=0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7{\%} of points in zone A, 10.3{\%} in zone B, and 1.9{\%} in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society. Conclusion: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9{\%} of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {It is important to know about a sudden blood pressure change that occurs in everyday life and may pose a danger to human health. However, monitoring the blood pressure variation in daily life is difficult because a bulky and expensive sensor is needed to measure the blood pressure continuously. In this study, a new non-contact method is proposed to estimate the blood pressure variation using video images. In this method, the pulse propagation time difference or instantaneous phase difference is calculated between two pulse waves obtained from different parts of a subject's body captured by a video camera. The forehead, left cheek, and right hand are selected as regions to obtain pulse waves. Both the pulse propagation time difference and instantaneous phase difference were calculated from the video images of 20 healthy subjects performing the Valsalva maneuver. These indices are considered to have a negative correlation with the blood pressure variation because they approximate the pulse transit time obtained from a photoplethysmograph. However, the experimental results showed that the correlation coefficients between the blood pressure and the proposed indices were approximately 0.6 for the pulse wave obtained from the right hand. This result is considered to be due to the difference in the transmission depth into the skin between the green and infrared light used as light sources for the video image and conventional photoplethysmogram, respectively. In addition, the difference in the innervation of the face and hand may be related to the results.},

Currently, contact PPG (cPPG) and imaging PPG (iPPG) are two feasible ways to obtain PPG signals. In this study, we proposed a hybrid system (called the ICPPG system) employing both methods that can be implemented on a wearable device, facilitating the measurement of BP in an inconspicuous way. The feasibility of the ICPPG system was validated on a dataset with 29 subjects. It has been proved that the ICPPG system is able to estimate PTT values. Moreover, the PTT measured by the new system shows a correlation on average with BP variations for most subjects, which could facilitate a new generation of BP measurement using wearable and mobile devices.},

As one of the most remarkable scientists, Ludwig invented the kymograph, which for the first time enabled the recording of continuous blood pressure (BP), opening the door to the modern study of physiology. Almost a century later, intraarterial BP monitoring through an arterial line has been used clinically. Subsequently, arterial tonometry and volume clamp method were developed and applied in continuous BP measurement in a noninvasive way. In the last two decades, additional efforts have been made to transform the method of unobtrusive continuous BP monitoring without the use of a cuff. This review summarizes the key milestones in continuous BP measurement; that is, kymograph, intraarterial BP monitoring, arterial tonometry, volume clamp method, and cuffless BP technologies. Our emphasis is on recent studies of unobtrusive BP measurements as well as on challenges and future directions.},

abstract = {Goal: We tested the hypothesis that the ballistocardiogram (BCG) waveform could yield a viable proximal timing reference for measuring pulse transit time (PTT). Methods: From 15 healthy volunteers, we measured PTT as the time interval between BCG and a noninvasively measured finger blood pressure (BP) waveform. To evaluate the efficacy of the BCG-based PTT in estimating BP, we likewise measured pulse arrival time (PAT) using the electrocardiogram (ECG) as proximal timing reference and compared their correlations to BP. Results: BCG-based PTT was correlated with BP reasonably well: the mean correlation coefficient (r ) was 0.62 for diastolic (DP), 0.65 for mean (MP), and 0.66 for systolic (SP) pressures when the intersecting tangent method was used as distal timing reference. Comparing four distal timing references (intersecting tangent, maximum second derivative, diastolic minimum, and systolic maximum), PTT exhibited the best correlation with BP when the systolic maximum method was used (mean r value was 0.66 for DP, 0.67 for MP, and 0.70 for SP). PTT was more strongly correlated with DP than PAT regardless of the distal timing reference: mean r value was 0.62 versus 0.51 (p = 0.07) for intersecting tangent, 0.54 versus 0.49 (p = 0.17) for maximum second derivative, 0.58 versus 0.52 (p = 0.37) for diastolic minimum, and 0.66 versus 0.60 (p = 0.10) for systolic maximum methods. The difference between PTT and PAT in estimating DP was significant (p = 0.01) when the r values associated with all the distal timing references were compared altogether. However, PAT appeared to outperform PTT in estimating SP ( p = 0.31 when the r values associated with all the distal timing references were compared altogether). Conclusion: We conclude that BCG is an adequate proximal timing reference in deriving PTT, and that BCG-based PTT may be superior to ECG-based PAT in estimating DP. Significance: PTT with BCG as proximal timing reference has potential to enable convenient and ubiquitous cuffless BP monitoring.},

abstract = {Recent studies demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) can be estimated using pulse transit time (PTT). For PTT calculation, photoplethysmogram (PPG) is usually used to detect a time lag in pulse wave propagation which is correlated with BP. Until now, PTT and PPG were registered using a set of body-worn sensors. In this study a new methodology is introduced allowing contactless registration of PTT and PPG using high speed camera resulting in corresponding image-based PTT (iPTT) and image-based PPG (iPPG) generation. The iPTT value can be potentially utilized for blood pressure estimation however extent of correlation between iPTT and BP is unknown. The goal of this preliminary feasibility study was to introduce the methodology for contactless generation of iPPG and iPTT and to make initial estimation of the extent of correlation between iPTT and BP “in vivo.” A short cycling exercise was used to generate BP changes in healthy adult volunteers in three consecutive visits. BP was measured by a verified BP monitor simultaneously with iPTT registration at three exercise points: rest, exercise peak, and recovery. iPPG was simultaneously registered at two body locations during the exercise using high speed camera at 420 frames per second. iPTT was calculated as a time lag between pulse waves obtained as two iPPG's registered from simultaneous recoding of head and palm areas. The average inter-person correlation between PTT and iPTT was 0.85 ± 0.08. The range of inter-person correlations between PTT and iPTT was from 0.70 to 0.95 (p {\textless} 0.05). The average inter-person coefficient of correlation between SBP and iPTT was -0.80 ± 0.12. The range of correlations between systolic BP and iPTT was from 0.632 to 0.960 with p {\textless} 0.05 for most of the participants. Preliminary data indicated that a high speed camera can be potentially utilized for unobtrusive contactless monitoring of abrupt blood pressure changes in a variety of settings. The initial prototype system was able to successfully generate approximation of pulse transit time and showed high intra-individual correlation between iPTT and BP. Further investigation of the proposed approach is warranted.},

abstract = {Remote sensing of the reflectance photoplethysmogram using a video camera typically positioned 1 m away from the patient's face is a promising method for monitoring the vital signs of patients without attaching any electrodes or sensors to them. Most of the papers in the literature on non-contact vital sign monitoring report results on human volunteers in controlled environments. We have been able to obtain estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate and preliminary results on changes in oxygen saturation from double-monitored patients undergoing haemodialysis in the Oxford Kidney Unit. To achieve this, we have devised a novel method of cancelling out aliased frequency components caused by artificial light flicker, using auto-regressive (AR) modelling and pole cancellation. Secondly, we have been able to construct accurate maps of the spatial distribution of heart rate and respiratory rate information from the coefficients of the AR model. In stable sections with minimal patient motion, the mean absolute error between the camera-derived estimate of heart rate and the reference value from a pulse oximeter is similar to the mean absolute error between two pulse oximeter measurements at different sites (finger and earlobe). The activities of daily living affect the respiratory rate, but the camera-derived estimates of this parameter are at least as accurate as those derived from a thoracic expansion sensor (chest belt). During a period of obstructive sleep apnoea, we tracked changes in oxygen saturation using the ratio of normalized reflectance changes in two colour channels (red and blue), but this required calibration against the reference data from a pulse oximeter. {\textcopyright} 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

The continuous relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular and renal events makes the distinction between high normal blood pressure and hypertension based on arbitrary cut-off values for blood pressures. Overall the prevalence of hypertension in different European countries appears to be around 30–45{\%} of the general population, with a steep increase with ageing. The prevention of cardiovascular disease and treatment recommendations should be related to quantification of total cardiovascular risk which could be estimated from several different models. However the impact of age on risk is so strong that young adults (particularly women) are unlikely to reach high-risk levels even when they have more than one major risk factor and a clear increase in relative risk. Therefore age-adjusted models, models assessing relative risks compared to others of same age and models including thorough assessments of target organ damage and ambulatory 24 h blood pressure are needed together with national models because of the large variations between countries.},

The measurement of PTT needs two photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensors or one electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor and one PPG sensor and thus restricted its widespread acceptance. In this study, a novel indicator, Photoplethysmography Acceleration Ratio (PAR), is extracted from the second-order derivative of PPG signal, which is validated as a significant parameter for estimating BP. 120 subjects, aged from 18 to 84, participated in this experiment. The results show that the correlation coefficient between PAR and systolic, diastolic and mean BP are 0.701, 0.331 and 0.629 respectively. Furthermore, the performance of accuracy and precision is good through correlation analysis. Therefore, the proposed PAR is demonstrated to be useful for SB measurement with only one sensor.},

abstract = {Pulse transit time has been proposed as a surrogate measure of systolic arterial pressure, as it is dependent upon arterial stiffness. Past research has shown that pulse transit time has a significant inverse relationship to systolic arterial pressure in adults; however, studies in children are limited. This study aimed to explore the relationship between systolic arterial pressure and pulse transit time in children during sleep. Twenty-five children (13.1 ± 1.6 years, 48{\%} male) underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) with a simultaneous recording of continuous systolic arterial pressure and photoplethysmography. Pulse transit time was calculated as the time delay between the R-wave peak of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to the 50{\%} point of the upstroke of the corresponding photoplethysmography waveform; 500 beats of simultaneous systolic arterial pressure and pulse transit time were analysed in each sleep stage for each child. Pulse transit time was normalized to each subject's mean wake pulse transit time. The ability of pulse transit time to predict systolic arterial pressure change was determined by linear mixed-effects modelling. Significant negative correlations between pulse transit time and systolic arterial pressure were found for individual children for each sleep stage [mean correlations for cohort: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep 1 and 2 r = -0.57, slow wave sleep (SWS) r = -0.76, REM r = -0.65, P {\textless} 0.01 for all]. Linear mixed-model analysis demonstrated that changes in pulse transit time were a significant predictor of changes in systolic arterial pressure for each sleep stage (P {\textless} 0.001). The model of pulse transit time-predicted systolic arterial pressure closely tracked actual systolic arterial pressure changes over time. This study demonstrated that pulse transit time was accurate in tracking systolic arterial pressure changes over time. Thus, the use of pulse transit time as a surrogate measure of changes in systolic arterial pressure in children is a valid, non-invasive and inexpensive method with many potential applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Sleep Research Society.},

Arterial catheter allows for a continuous and precise monitoring of arterial pressure signal. In addition to giving a precise MBP monitoring, analysis of the blood pressure wave provides information that may help the clinician to interpret hemodynamic status. The interpretation of BP wave requires the understanding of simple principles. In this review, we first discuss the physiological mechanism responsible for arterial pressure generation. We then emphasize the interpretation of the static indexes and the dynamic indexes generated by heart-lung interactions derived from arterial pressure wave. Finally, we focus on MBP value as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients. We discuss the recommended target MBP value by reviewing available data from experimental and clinical studies.},

abstract = {The advent of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring permitted examination of blood pressures during sleep and recognition of the associated circadian fall in pressure during this period. The fall in pressure, called the "dip", is defined as the difference between daytime mean systolic pressure and nighttime mean systolic pressure expressed as a percentage of the day value. Ten percent to 20{\%} is considered normal. Dips less than 10{\%}, referred to as blunted or absent, have been considered as predicting an adverse cardiovascular event. This view and the broader concept that white coat hypertension itself is a forerunner of essential hypertension is disputable. This editorial questions whether mean arterial pressures over many hours accurately represent the systolic load, whether nighttime dipping varies from measure to measure or is a fixed phenomenon, whether the abrupt morning pressure rise is a risk factor or whether none of these issues are as important as the actual night time systolic blood pressure itself. The paper discusses the difference between medicated and nonmedicated white coat hypertensives in regard to the cardiovascular risk and suggests that further work is necessary to consider whether the quality and duration of sleep are important factors.},

abstract = {Numerous studies addressed the predictive value of the nighttime blood pressure (BP) as captured by ambulatory monitoring. However, arbitrary cutoff limits in dichotomized analyses of continuous variables, data dredging across selected subgroups, extrapolation of cross-sectional studies to prospective outcomes, and lack of comprehensive adjustments for confounders make interpretation of the literature difficult. We reviewed prospective studies with total mortality or a composite cardiovascular end point as an outcome in relation to the level and the circadian profile of systolic BP. We analyzed studies in hypertensive patients (n=23 856) separately from those in individuals randomly recruited from populations (n=9641). We pooled summary statistics and individual subject data, respectively. In both patients and populations, in analyses in which nighttime BP was additionally adjusted for daytime BP and vice versa, nighttime BP was a stronger predictor than daytime BP. With adjustment for the 24-hour BP, both the night-to-day BP ratio and dipping status remained significant predictors of outcome but added little prognostic value over and beyond the 24-hour BP level. In the absence of conclusive evidence proving that nondipping is a reversible risk factor, the option whether or not to restore the diurnal blood pressure profile to a normal pattern should be left to the clinical judgment of doctors and should be individualized for each patient. Current guidelines on the interpretation of ambulatory BP recording need to be updated. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Blood Pressure (BP) is a crucial vital sign taken into consideration for the general assessment of patient's condition: patients with hypertension or hypotension are advised to record their BP routinely. Particularly, hypertension is emphasized by stress, diabetic neuropathy and coronary heart diseases and could lead to stroke. Therefore, routine and long-term monitoring can enable early detection of symptoms and prevent life-threatening events. The gold standard method for measuring BP is the use of a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer to detect systolic and diastolic pressures. However, only discrete measurements are taken. To enable pervasive and continuous monitoring of BP, recent methods have been proposed: pulse arrival time (PAT) or PAT difference (PATD) between different body parts are based on the combination of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. Nevertheless, this technique could be quite obtrusive as in addition to at least two contacts/electrodes to measure the differential voltage across the left arm/leg/chest and the right arm/leg/chest, ECG measurements are easily corrupted by motion artefacts. Although such devices are small, wearable and relatively convenient to use, most devices are not designed for continuous BP measurements. This paper introduces a novel PPG-based pervasive sensing platform for continuous measurements of BP. Based on the principle of using PAT to estimate BP, two PPG sensors are used to measure the PATD between the earlobe and the wrist to measure BP. The device is compared with a gold standard PPG sensor and validation of the concept is conducted with a preliminary study involving 9 healthy subjects. Results show that the mean BP and PATD are correlated with a 0.3 factor. This preliminary study shows the feasibility of continuous monitoring of BP using a pair of PPG placed on the ear lobe and wrist with PATD measurements is possible.},

The potential use of the proposed system in cuffless blood pressure (BP) techniques was demonstrated. Approach: Initial validation measurements were performed on a phantom using a reference method. Further, an in vivo study was carried out in 35 volunteers (age = 28 ± 4.5 years). The carotid local PWV, carotid to finger pulse transit time (PTTR) and pulse arrival time at the carotid artery (PATC) were simultaneously measured. Beat-by-beat variation of the local PWV due to BP changes was studied during post-exercise relaxation. The cuffless BP estimation accuracy of local PWV, PATC, and PTTR was investigated based on inter- and intra-subject models with best-case calibration. Main results: The accuracy of the proposed system, hardware inter-channel delay ({\textless}0.1 ms), repeatability (beat-to-beat variation = 4.15{\%}-11.38{\%}) and reproducibility of measurement (r = 0.96) were examined. For the phantom experiment, the measured PWV values did not differ by more than 0.74 m s-1 compared to the reference PWV. Better correlation was observed between brachial BP parameters versus local PWV (r = 0.74-0.78) compared to PTTR (|r| = 0.62-0.67) and PATC (|r| = 0.52-0.68). Cuffless BP estimation using local PWV was better than PTTR and PATC with population-specific models. More accurate estimates of arterial BP levels were achieved using local PWV via subject-specific models (root-mean-square error 2.61 mmHg). Significance: A reliable system for cuffless BP measurement and local estimation of arterial wall properties.},

abstract = {In this work we explore the viability of a multimodal sensing device that can be integrated in a wearable form factor for daily, non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. A common approach in previous research has been to rely on measuring the pulse transit time (PTT), which has been shown to be correlated with the BP. In this work, we look into the feasibility of measuring PTT using sensors separated by a small distance on one arm so that any eventual realization of the system is convenient to wear and use over long periods of time. Moreover, we investigate the combined use of two different modalities for cardiovascular measurement: the optical photoplethysmogram (PPG) as well as the bio-potential based impedance (Bio-Z) measurement. These two modalities have been previously only studied on their own or in conjunction with the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the purpose of estimating PTT. We measure the PTT from the wrist to the finger using Bio-Z and PPG sensors, and compare it to the conventional PTT measured from the ECG to PPG at the finger, in order to prove that it can be an effective replacement for existing PTT measurement strategies. Moreover, successful measurement of PTT with two different modalities of sensors at close proximity will allow designs with multiple heterogeneous sensors on a more versatile wearable sensing platform that is optimized for power and is more robust to environmental or skin contact changes. This will enable the next generation of smart watches that capture PTT and BP. Experiments were conducted in vivo with simultaneous ECG, Bio-Z and PPG sensors, and results indicate that the PTT calculated from the Bio-Z and PPG sensors placed at a close distance correlates well with the more established PTT measurement using the ECG in conjunction with PPG, with correlation coefficient as high as 0.92.},

abstract = {Cardiac output (CO) is an important indicator of cardiovascular function. Several invasive and non-invasive methods have been developed and validated to assess CO in the clinical setting. These are often computationally complex or proprietarily-restricted, and thus, not feasible in ambulatory investigations and the laboratory research setting. Simple mathematical transforms have been proposed to estimate CO from pulse pressure (PP = mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) minus mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), and mean heart rate (HR). Recently we evaluated one such simple technique [CO=(PPxHR)x.002] , and found moderate correlation between the CO estimate and Modelflow-derived CO. Here we aimed to evaluate a more sophisticated formula, proposed in 1940 by Liljestrand and Zander. CO was estimated (COest) dividing PP by the sum of SBP and DBP and multiplying the product by HR. This index was correlated with the Modelflow (3 element Windkessel)-derived CO. Baseline beat-to-beat blood pressure data from 67 young (mean age = 19.94± 2.8), healthy men (n = 30) and women (n = 37) was available for analysis. Overall, the correlation of COest and CO was moderate (r = .42, p {\textless}.0001) and stronger in men (r = .66, p {\textless} .0001) compared to women (r = .36, p {\textless} .05). These results suggest that at least in some situations the Liljestrand and Zander method may provide an adequate measure of CO when other methods are not available.},

abstract = {Background: Blood pressure is a critical bio-signal and its importance has been increased with the aged society and the growth of cardiovascular disease population. However, most of hypertensive patients have been suffered the inconvenience in monitoring blood pressure in daily life because the measurement of the blood pressure depends on the cuff-based technique. Nowadays there are many trials to measure blood pressure without cuff, especially, photoplethysmography (PPG) based research is carried out in various ways. Methods: Our research is designed to hypothesis the relationship between vessel wall movement and pressure-flow relationship of PPG and to validate its appropriateness by experimental methods. PPG waveform is simplified by approximate model, and then it is analyzed as the velocity and the acceleration of blood flow using the derivatives of PPG. Finally, we develop pressure index (PI) as an estimation factor of blood pressure by combining of statistically significant segments of photoplethysmographic waveform. Results: Twenty-five subjects were participated in the experiment. As a result of simulation, correlation coefficients between developed PI and blood pressure were represented with R = 0.818, R = 0.827 and R = 0.615 in systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure, respectively, and both of result showed the meaningful statistically significance (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: Current study can estimate only the relative variation of blood pressure but could not find the absolute pressure value. Moreover, proposed index has the limitation of diastolic pressure tracing. However, the result shows that the proposed PI is statistically significantly correlated with blood pressures, and it suggests that the proposed PI as a promising additional parameter for the cuff less blood pressure monitoring.},

abstract = {Goal: Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring can provide invaluable information about individuals' health conditions. However, BP is conventionally measured using inconvenient cuff-based instruments, which prevents continuous BP monitoring. This paper presents an efficient algorithm, based on the pulse arrival time (PAT), for the continuous and cuffless estimation of the systolic BP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) values. Methods: The proposed framework estimates the BP values through processing vital signals and extracting two types of features, which are based on either physiological parameters or whole-based representation of vital signals. Finally, the regression algorithms are employed for the BP estimation. Although the proposed algorithm works reliably without any need for calibration, an optional calibration procedure is also suggested, which can improve the system's accuracy even further. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on about a thousand subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards. The method complies with the AAMI standard in the estimation of DBP and MAP values. Regarding the BHS protocol, the results achieve grade A for the estimation of DBP and grade B for the estimation of MAP. Conclusion: We conclude that by using the PAT in combination with informative features from the vital signals, the BP can be accurately and reliably estimated in a noninvasive fashion. Significance: The results indicate that the proposed algorithm for the cuffless estimation of the BP can potentially enable mobile health-care gadgets to monitor the BP continuously.},

For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.},

abstract = {Highbloodpressure (BP) is amajor cardiovascular risk factor that is treatable, yet hypertension awareness and control rates are low. Ubiquitous BP monitoring technology could improve hypertension management, but existing devices require an inflatable cuff and are not compatible with such anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. We extended the oscillometric principle, which is used by most automatic cuff devices, to develop a cuff-less BP monitoring device using a smartphone. As the user presses her/his finger against the smartphone, the external pressure of the underlying artery is steadily increased while the phone measures the applied pressure and resulting variableamplitude blood volume oscillations. A smartphone application provides visual feedback to guide the amount of pressure applied over time via the finger pressing and computes systolic and diastolic BP from the measurements. We prospectively tested the smartphone-based device for real-time BPmonitoring in human subjects to evaluate usability (n = 30) and accuracy against a standard automatic cuff-based device (n = 32). We likewise tested a finger cuff device, which uses the volume-clamp method of BP detection. About 90{\%} of the users learned the finger actuation required by the smartphone-based device after one or two practice trials. The device yielded bias and precision errors of 3.3 and 8.8mmHg for systolic BP and -5.6 and 7.7mmHg for diastolic BP over a 40 to 50mmHg range of BP. These errorswere comparable to the finger cuff device. Cuff-less and calibration-freemonitoring of systolic and diastolic BP may be feasible via a smartphone.},

In this paper, we present a methodology to estimate Blood Pressure (BP) using Photoplethysmography (PPG). Instead of directly relating systolic and diastolic BP values with PPG features, our proposed methodology initially maps PPG features with some person specific intermediate latent parameters and later derives BP values from them. The 2-Element Windkessel model has been considered in the current context to estimate total peripheral resistance and arterial compliance of a person using PPG features, followed by linear regression for simulating arterial blood pressure. Experimental results, performed on a standard hospital dataset yielded absolute errors of0.78±13. 1 mmHg and0.59±10.23 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP values respectively. Results also indicate that the methodology is more robust than the standard methodologies that directly estimate Bp values from PPG signal},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this paper was to compare photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals measured from the wrist and finger and to evaluate if wrist PPG signal could be used to calculate pulse arrival time (PAT), the time delay between electrocardiogram (ECG) R peak and a feature (e.g. peak, foot, first derivative peak) in the PPG signal. Further, the correlation between pulse wave velocity (rePWV, defined as PWV from ECG R peak to extremity) and systolic blood pressure was studied. Approach: Thirty subjects were measured at rest by a trained research nurse. For reference measurement, chest ECG and finger PPG were measured using commercial sensors. Wrist PPG and arm ECG were measured with a custom-made setup, where the PPG sensor was located at the back surface of the forearm. Main results: Reference finger and wrist PPG signals were found to differ in shape and also in amplitude. The PPG foot or first derivative peak detection methods seemed to be the most suitable methods for wrist PAT calculation. The Pearson correlation coefficient between blood pressure and rePWV was found to be 0.44 for the reference finger measurement and 0.37 for the wrist measurement. Significance: Wrist PPG signal is widely used in optical heart rate monitors. Based on the results obtained in this study, wrist PPG signal may be used also for PAT calculation. The use of PAT for blood pressure estimation still has challenges, but PAT as such could be used as an interesting indicator of vascular health.},

abstract = {Introduction Pulse transit time (PTT) is the duration that a pulse wave takes to travel between two different arterial points, and it may be useful in estimating blood pressure. The aim of this study was to investigate the PTT during carotid artery stenting, as well as its value in blood pressure estimation. Method Thirty-four patients with critical carotid artery stenosis were enrolled in this study. The carotid PTT from the onset of the R-wave of electrocardiography to the pulse waveform at the carotid artery, obtained invasively during carotid artery catheterization, was measured. The carotid PTT was measured before and after stenting of the internal carotid artery. Results The mean age was 70.4±8.0 years among the 34 patients enrolled (eight female patients, 21.9{\%}). Measurements were obtained before and after carotid artery stenting. The heart rate (85.9±15.9 vs. 76.9±12.5 bpm, P{\textless}0.01), systolic blood pressure (162.8±28.6 vs. 126.0±31.7 mmHg, P{\textless}0.001), diastolic blood pressure (87.7±17.9 vs. 76.9±20.0 mmHg, P{\textless}0.01), and mean blood pressure (112.7±18.6 vs. 93.2±22.7 mmHg, P{\textless}0.001) were significantly decreased, whereas the carotid PTT (0.06±0.012 s vs. 0.07±0.012 s, P{\textless}0.001) was significantly increased after carotid stenting. The difference between the PTTs was negatively correlated with the systolic blood pressure (r=-0.35, P=0.02) and diastolic blood pressure (r=-0.4, P=0.01). Conclusion After carotid stenting, the PTT increases significantly because of the lowering of the blood pressure. However, the relationship is not strong enough for the PTT to be used for blood pressure estimation.},

We have also included a small number of articles that appeared over the last few years and had an impact on our understanding of the back-propagation mechanism. The chapters distinguish the theory of back propagation from architectures and applications. The theoretical chapters relate back-propagation principles to statistics, pattern recognition, and dynamical system theory. They show that back-propagation networks can be viewed as non-parametrized, non-linear, structured, statistical models. The architectures and applications chapters then show successful implementations of the algorithm for speech processing, fingerprint recognition, process control, etc. This volume is intended to be useful not only to students in the field of artificial neural networks, but also to professionals who are looking for concrete applications of learning machine systems in general and of the back-propagation algorithm in particular.

abstract = {In this work, a model to estimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) is proposed. Data from 19 subjects doing a 40 min exercise was analyzed. Reference SBP was measured at the finger based on the volume-clamp principle. PPG signals were measured at the finger and forehead. After an initialization process for each subject at rest, the model estimated SBP every 30 s for the whole period of exercise. In order to build this model, 18 features were extracted from PPG signals by means of its waveform, first derivative, second derivative, and frequency spectrum. In addition, pulse arrival time (PAT) was derived as a feature from the combination of PPG and ECG. After evaluating four regression models, we chose multiple linear regression (MLR) to combine all derived features to estimate SBP. The contribution of each feature was quantified using its normalized weight in the MLR. To evaluate the performance of the model, we used a leave-one-subject-out cross validation. With the aim of exploring the potential of the model, we investigated the influences of the inclusion of PAT, regression models, measurement sites (finger and forehead), and posture change (lying, sitting, and standing). The results show that the inclusion of PAT reduced the standard deviation (SD) of the difference from 14.07 to 13.52 mmHg. There was no significant difference in the estimation performance between the model using finger- and forehead-derived PPG signals. Separate models are necessary for different postures. The optimized model using finger-derived PPG signals during physical exercise had a performance with a mean difference of 0.43 mmHg, an SD of difference of 13.52 mmHg, and median correlation coefficients of 0.86. Furthermore, we identified two groups of features that contributed more to SBP estimation compared to other features. One group consists of our proposed features depicting beat morphology. The other comprises existing features depicting the dicrotic notch. The present work demonstrates promising results of the SBP estimation model during physical exercise.},

However, it is not currently routinely assessed. The aim of this study was to identify features of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse wave which are indicative of mental stress. Approach: A numerical model of pulse wave propagation was used to simulate blood pressure signals, from which simulated PPG pulse waves were estimated using a transfer function. Pulse waves were simulated at six levels of stress by changing the model input parameters both simultaneously and individually, in accordance with haemodynamic changes associated with stress. Thirty-two feature measurements were extracted from pulse waves at three measurement sites: the brachial, radial and temporal arteries. Features which changed significantly with stress were identified using the Mann-Kendall monotonic trend test. Main results: Seventeen features exhibited significant trends with stress in measurements from at least one site. Three features showed significant trends at all three sites: the time from pulse onset to peak, the time from the dicrotic notch to pulse end, and the pulse rate. More features showed significant trends at the radial artery (15) than the brachial (8) or temporal (7) arteries. Most features were influenced by multiple input parameters. Significance: The features identified in this study could be used to monitor stress in healthcare and consumer devices. Measurements at the radial artery may provide superior performance than the brachial or temporal arteries. In vivo studies are required to confirm these observations.},

@article{Payne2006,
abstract = {The arterial pulse-wave transit time can be measured between the ECG R-wave and the finger pulse (rPTT), and has been shown previously to have a linear correlation with blood pressure (BP). We hypothesized that the relationship between rPTT, preejection period (PEP; the R-wave/ mechanical cardiac delay), and BP would vary with different vasoactive drugs. Twelve healthy men (mean age 22 yr) were studied. Beat-to-beat measurements were made of rPTT (using ECG and photoplethysmograph finger probe), intra-arterial radial pressure, PEP (using cardiac bioimpedance), and transit time minus PEP (pPTT). Four drugs (glyceryl trinitrate, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, salbutamol) were administered intravenously over 15 min, with stepped dosage increase every 5 min and a 25-min saline washout between agents. All subjects in all conditions had a negative linear correlation (R2 = 0.39) between rPTT and systolic BP (SBP), generally constant between different drugs, apart from four subjects who had a positive rPTT/SBP correlation with salbutamol. The 95{\%} limits of agreement between measured and rPTT-predicted SBP were ±17.0 mmHg. Beat-to-beat variability of rPTT showed better coherence with SBP variability than it did with heart rate variability (P {\textless} 0.001). PEP accounted for a substantial and variable proportion of rPTT (12-35{\%}). Diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial BP (MAP) correlated poorly with rPTT (R2 = 0.02 and 0.08, respectively) but better with pPTT (rPTT corrected for PEP, R2 = 0.41 and 0.45, respectively). The 95{\%} limits of agreement between measured and pPTT-predicted DBP were ± 17.3 mmHg. In conclusion, the negative correlation between rPTT and SBP is generally constant, even with marked hemodynamic perturbations. However, the relationship is not reliable enough for rPTT to be used as a surrogate marker of SBP, although it may be useful in assessing BP variability. DBP and MAP cannot be predicted from rPTT without correction for PEP. The significant contribution of PEP to rPTT means that rPTT should not be used as a marker of purely vascular function.

The dataset covers an age range of 20-89 years and records of diseases including hypertension and diabetes. Data acquisition was carried out under the control of standard experimental conditions and specifications. This dataset can be used to carry out the study of photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal quality evaluation and to explore the intrinsic relationship between the PPG waveform and cardiovascular disease to discover and evaluate latent characteristic information contained in PPG signals. These data can also be used to study early and noninvasive screening of common CVD such as hypertension and other related CVD diseases such as diabetes.},
